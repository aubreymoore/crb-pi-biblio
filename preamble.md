This bibliography is my attempt to gather and share scientific and technical information about coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), 
*Oryctes rhinoceros*, in the Philippines.

## Technical details
The primary data source is a private Zotero **CRB** library built by myself and Dr. Jim Grasela.
The Zotero advanced search facility to extracted all bibliographic records 
which had the text string **Philippine** anywhere in fields, attached documents (such as PDFs) and attached notes.
    The search result was exported as a spreadsheet, **crb-pi-bib.csv**, 
    which was then formatted as this web page, **index.html**, by a Python Jupyter notebook, **crb-pi-bib.ipynb**.

The data and code files I just mentioned are stored in a public GitHub repository
    at [https://github.com/aubreymoore/crb-pi-biblio](https://github.com/aubreymoore/crb-pi-biblio)
    and the most recent web page you are currently reading is made available 
    at [https://aubreymoore.github.io/crb-pi-biblio](https://aubreymoore.github.io/crb-pi-biblio).

## Interesting discoveries
I have only just started reading through references in **crb-pi-bib** but I have already come across 
    a few which I find particularly interesting.

* Cell cultures of OrNV isolates collected in the Philippines [Hiszczynska-Sawicka et al. 2024](index.html#NV2VFWYS)
* Breeding sites in dead standing palms is the best place to find OrNV [Zelazny and Alfiler 1986](index.html#E5I5WF8C)
* OrNV infection halts reproduction. [Prasad et al. 2008](index.html#P3FSEJQZ)

## To do
The search for **Phillipine** selects many references which are not very relevent. 
    For instance, any references which simply state that the Philippines is within the original natural range of CRB is selected. 
    I will figure out how to handle this problem soon.
