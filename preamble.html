<p>This bibliography is my attempt to gather and share scientific and technical information about coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em>, in the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>
<p>The primary data source is a private Zotero <strong>CRB</strong> library built by myself and Dr. Jim Grasela. The Zotero advanced search facility to extracted all bibliographic records which had the text string <strong>Philippine</strong> anywhere in fields, attached documents (such as PDFs) and attached notes. The search result was exported as a spreadsheet, <strong>crb-pi-bib.csv</strong>, which was then formatted as this web page, <strong>index.html</strong>, by a Python Jupyter notebook, <strong>crb-pi-bib.ipynb</strong>.</p>
<p>The data and code files I just mentioned are stored in a public GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/aubreymoore/crb-pi-biblio">https://github.com/aubreymoore/crb-pi-biblio</a> and the most recent web page you are currently reading is made available at <a href="https://aubreymoore.github.io/crb-pi-biblio">https://aubreymoore.github.io/crb-pi-biblio</a>.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-discoveries">Interesting discoveries</h2>
<p>I have only just started reading through references in <strong>crb-pi-bib</strong> but I have already come across a few which I find particularly interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell cultures of OrNV isolates collected in the Philippines <a href="index.html#NV2VFWYS">Hiszczynska-Sawicka et al. 2024</a></li>
<li>Breeding sites in dead standing palms is the best place to find OrNV <a href="index.html#E5I5WF8C">Zelazny and Alfiler 1986</a></li>
<li>OrNV infection halts reproduction. <a href="index.html#P3FSEJQZ">Prasad et al. 2008</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-do">To do</h2>
<p>The search for <strong>Phillipine</strong> selects many references which are not very relevent. For instance, any references which simply state that the Philippines is within the original natural range of CRB is selected. I will figure out how to handle this problem soon.</p>
