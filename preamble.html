<p>This bibliography is my attempt to gather and share scientific and technical information about coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), 
    <i>Oryctes rhinoceros</i>, in the Philippines.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Technical details</b></p>
<br>
<p>The primary data source is a private Zotero <b>CRB</b> library built by myself and Dr. Jim Grasela.
    The Zotero advanced search facility to extracted all bibliographic records 
    which had the text string <b>Philippine</b> anywhere in fields, attached documents (such as PDFs) and attached notes.
    The search result was exported as a spreadsheet, <b>crb-pi-bib.csv</b>, 
    which was then formatted as this web page, <b>index.html</b>, by a Python Jupyter notebook, <b>crb-pi-bib.ipynb</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>The data and code files I just mentioned are stored in a public GitHub repository
    at <a href="https://github.com/aubreymoore/crb-pi-biblio">https://github.com/aubreymoore/crb-pi-biblio</a>
    and the most recent web page you are currently reading is made available 
    at <a href="https://aubreymoore.github.io/crb-pi-biblio">https://aubreymoore.github.io/crb-pi-biblio</a>.</p>

<p><b>Interesting discoveries</b></p>
<br>
<p>I have only just started reading through references in <b>crb-pi-bib</b> but I have already come across 
    a few which I find particularly interesting.
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
            Cell cultures of OrNV isolates collected in the Philippines.
            <a href="index.html#NV2VFWYS">Hiszczynska-Sawicka et al. (2024)</a>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Breeding sites in dead standing palms is the best place to find OrNV.
            <a href="index.html#E5I5WF8C">Zelazny and Alfiler (1986)</a>
        </li> 

        <li>
            OrNV halts reproduction.
            <a href="index.html#P3FSEJQZ">Prasad et al. (2008)</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p><b>To do</b></p>
<br>
<p>The search for <b>Phillipine</b> selects many references which are not very relevent. 
    For instance, any references which simply state that the Philippines is within the original natural range of CRB is selected. 
    I will figure out how to handle this problem soon.</p>
