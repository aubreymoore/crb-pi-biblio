            <div class="abstract">
                Due to the extensive stretches of date plantation and topography of traditional grooves in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt,the red palm weevil (RPW) early detection is a signiﬁcant challenge. The RPW is a palm borer insect that develops within the soft tissues of the trunk and crown, eventually leading to tree death. Early detection of RPW infestation is crucial because,at an early stage of infestation,palms can be treated more efﬁciently and saved,while the determination of treatment efﬁcacy is hugely vital to optimize palm rescue efforts. Detection is often particularly problematic since not all palms can be accessed and inspected directly. Thermography technique can determine the thermal properties of any objects of interest, and it is a non-destructive. In thermography, the invisible radiation patternsaretransformedtovisibleimagescalledthermalimages.Thosethermalimages are acquired using speciﬁc sensors that can be coupled with many available optical systems. Due to the simple operating procedure and the noticeable reductions in equipment cost of thermal imaging systems, it gains popularity in pests’ detection. This chapter discusses the state-of-the-art research concerning the detection methods for detecting infected Palm trees.The study will concentrate on the thermal imaging and its application on red palm weevil detection.

                Anggraini E, Sinaga TM, Irsan C, Herlinda S, Muslim A, Hamidson H, Sefrila M, Kurnianingsih A, Aryani D, Antoni M, Ikhsan Z. 2024. Insects found in different ages of coconut viridis variety in Sri Tiga Village, Banyuasin District, South Sumatra, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 25: 2637-2647. Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is a high-value export commodity and has promising potential on the global market. The existence of insect species is very important in coconut cultivation. The coexistence of insects and plants is interconnected because plants provide habitat and food sources for insects. However, the correlation between plants and insects still needs to be discovered to many people. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of insect biodiversity in an environment is important to be carried out. This study revealed the structure of the insect community associated with coconut plants and weeds around coconut trees. Therefore, this is a novel and pioneering study that aims to determine the insects associated with coconut plants. This study was conducted by surveying community-owned coconut plantations in Sri Tiga Village, Sumber Marga Telang Sub-district, Banyuasin District, South Sumatera, Indonesia. The observation was carried out during July and September of 2023. The data-gathering process involved identifying three coconut plantations with varying ages of coconut trees (8, 5, and 2 years old). Data collection was carried out using the purposive sampling method by direct observations and using traps such as insect nets, light traps, and pheromone traps. Collected specimens were identified using a microscope in the Laboratory of Entomology, Department of Plant Pests and Disease, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Sriwijaya. The results of this study found 12 insect species in coconut trees, namely Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus 1758, Aspidiotus sp., Nipaecoccus nipae Maskell 1893, Aleurocanthus sp., Apis cerana Fabricius 1793, Cotesia congregata Say 1836, Dolichoderus thoracicus Smith 1860, Oecophylla smaragdina Fabricus 1775, Provespa sp., Pteroma pendula de Joannis 1929, Metura sp., Metisa plana Walker 1883. The predominant insect pests identified were Aspidiotus sp., N. nipae, and Aleurocanthus sp. Furthermore, the most predominant insects that served as insect scavengers were Polyrhachis sp. and O. smaragdina. Meanwhile, in the weeds around coconut trees, there were found six insect species, namely Aulacophora lewisii Baly 1866, Eumorphus westwoodi Guérin 1858, Mactrotermes sp., Conocephalus sp., Dianemobius sp., and Tettigidea sp.

prepared and I'm going</p> <p>to introduce our two moderators for the Q&amp;A session and then hand it over to</p> <p>them to take it away and finish us off here um and one second just pull up my</p> <p>document which of course just disappeared because that's the way it works um and</p> <p>so uh moderating our session our Q&amp;A session here today uh we have Chelsea AR</p> <p>not the invasive species coordinator uh with the Hawaii invasive species Council</p> <p>and the department of land and Natural Resources Division of Forestry and</p> <p>Wildlife and Christy Martin who is the program manager for the coordinating</p> <p>group on alien pest species at the University of Hawaii at Manoa thank you so so</p> <p>much and I'll hand it over to you both yeah thanks Elliot appreciate it and rest</p> <p>of the planning team this Symposium has been great I've learned a ton and this</p> <p>is always my favorite part is having discussion and time for Q&amp;A so um hoping we</p> <p>can get through a few questions here but I know the planning team is if there</p> <p>are unanswered questions like Franny mentioned they are planning to try to get</p> <p>responses to those questions and put them together at a with a summary at the</p> <p>end of the Symposium that will be sent out to folks great so we haven't</p> <p>practiced at all but if you would like we can take turns on questions you're</p> <p>gonna see how much we haven't practiced right now but maybe first if we could</p> <p>ask the panelists that are still here with us we have some folks from</p> <p>yesterday's Symposium and then the folks that are still able to join from today</p> <p>if you could um at turn your cameras on that would be wonderful and we're going</p> <p>to kind of round robin through some of the questions that came through the chat</p> <p>over the last two days um some of the questions you know they're bigger broader</p> <p>questions and then we do have a few questions that are more focused to those</p> <p>panelists and we'll make sure to direct those but if any folks any panelists on</p> <p>here um have thoughts on a question that might not have been directed to you</p> <p>feel free to chime in but Christy and I I will be moderating so we'll try to</p> <p>keep um things concise so we can move on to um other questions that are here</p> <p>because we got a lot but yeah Christy maybe I'll shoot it over to you if you</p> <p>want to start with the first question sure thanks so much Chelsea um thanks</p> <p>everybody for great presentations I learned uh a ton I've got lots of notes now</p> <p>uh I think a lot of questions really focused on um on pesticides so it's kind of</p> <p>a two-part question I think maybe starting with Keith um first of all what are</p> <p>the best alternatives to pesticide that are available right now people are are</p> <p>in need um and then I guess you know we're going to talk a little bit after that</p> <p>about what are the best ways to minimize impacts from pesticides when we</p> <p>absolutely have to use them which we do so Keith are you able to answer that</p> <p>first part best Alternatives available right now yeah and and it depends where</p> <p>you are because I know we have some people from across the Pacific and so we</p> <p>heard a lot about bio controls and most of those are not available currently in</p> <p>Hawaii but there is some work uh going in that direction to get those uh here in</p> <p>Hawaii but um um green waste management is probably the number one um as you saw</p> <p>in my talk and other people's talks it can be very effective as long as it can</p> <p>be done on a landscape scale um that's the biggest thing and then uh there's</p> <p>also um use of netting in specific ways on uh breeding sites potential breeding</p> <p>sites and in trees is another is another alternative so but sanitation by far is</p> <p>the the most effective even even if you're using pesticide sanitation is</p> <p>strongly advised so controlling all the potential breeding material at a</p> <p>landscape scale thank you turn it over to Chelsea thanks Christie and and like</p> <p>we said if other panelists have um anything to add on to these questions feel</p> <p>free to just unmute yourself and add-on um I'm going to go for one of these</p> <p>bigger questions that might circle around to a few folks here um how can we</p> <p>support communities where eradication is no longer an option A lot of what we</p> <p>have seen to over the last two days comes from you know a lot of efforts that</p> <p>are being taken on by the communities because they don't feel supported um here</p> <p>in Hawaii with the actions and the tools that we currently have so maybe we can</p> <p>hear from a few folks from um the other Pacific Islands and and learn from have</p> <p>some lessons learned there Chris maybe yeah you would be great the kick us off</p> <p>sorry can you repeat that I was talking to a student um so the question is how</p> <p>can we support communities where eradication is no longer an option oh um so</p> <p>just the stuff we've done is um um I think the best example would be like I when</p> <p>French P eradicated the um the uh orientalis it's Comm Community Based messaging</p> <p>and having people from the community that are not prominent but like you know</p> <p>because some time prominent members are politicians so it's just having</p> <p>community action committees put together local people having it in their own</p> <p>language and then kind of having them look at it as an economic um deterrent I</p> <p>kind of stopped a lot of the work here because people weren't seeing major</p> <p>damage um but what people brought up was like okay now they could damage the</p> <p>betelnut trees and then everybody got crazy so it's finding those components</p> <p>and that's where the Teek where the the working directly with the communities</p> <p>and the students um to handle it makes things less expensive and and stuff that</p> <p>lasts longer so and you know I what we've just been trying to do is make sure</p> <p>that we all talk together and share you know we're trying to get the virus out</p> <p>if you got it here if you got new methods there um just share as opposed to you</p> <p>know this grant driven kind of Drive have like a goal and and make sure that the</p> <p>community is there with you and um then uh I think you know if it's just grant</p> <p>driven stuff kind of stops that's what I've seen I'm not professional and</p> <p>invasives but that's what I've kind of seen if there's no sort of specific</p> <p>granting mechanism it goes away right after or but um when it's a</p> <p>community-driven thing they kind of put uh uh activities aside for me members of</p> <p>the community that are already sort of funded and when it goes to the</p> <p>universities and like this is why I came to the land grant system is that</p> <p>there's a set structure there and people there for longer periods of time and</p> <p>you have a rotation of students coming through so I really see the universities</p> <p>and high schools and and and even down to the the Head Start programs which</p> <p>we're working in now um as as really um peer mentoring with that traditional</p> <p>knowledge component and the Western science coming in together so it's not</p> <p>separated it's under one integrated model and they like integrated Pest</p> <p>Management is an integrated Teek and test management that's great thanks so much</p> <p>Chris I see Aubrey you had your hand up and then Andrea you want to add on yeah</p> <p>uh so one of the talks yesterday mentioned a great idea and that was having</p> <p>Community trapping and uh the idea was to put up um panel traps pheromone traps</p> <p>and have people monitor those in their backyards um I think a better way would</p> <p>be to use the the Tekken idea The netting you can use that as a very cheap and</p> <p>efficient uh pheromone trap all you have to do is attach it to a fence or even wrap</p> <p>it around a coconut uh stem and and hang a lure there um these lures aren't</p> <p>aren't cheap by the way they're they're $4 a piece and they only last about 10</p> <p>weeks but the netting is extremely cheap and here here's a kicker you don't even</p> <p>need the lure if you have a small pile of green waste you just cover it with a</p> <p>piece of this Tekken maybe you know four square meters of it and The Beetles</p> <p>will very quickly uh start arriving and once you get a bunch of males in there</p> <p>um they're your lures they're putting out the the natural Arial lure so um this</p> <p>netting is available in bulk it comes in in Bales which are 17 ft wide and 1</p> <p>kilometer long when it's stretched out it's about $800 for for one of these</p> <p>Bales so if you had um a bail on each of the Hawaiian islands and and just you</p> <p>know cut it up into into squares and gave that away that would be a great way of</p> <p>of starting things off because you're actually doing sanitation at the same time</p> <p>right yeah Mahalo Aubrey I think you just like covered like three questions we</p> <p>had there so these piles can be used as early detection you can have them in in</p> <p>places where you don't expect to find rhino beetle and they they will likely be</p> <p>discovered first as adults on those piles right on thanks Aubrey Andre whoops</p> <p>sorry I was on mute so I think Aubrey covered um some of what I wanted to say</p> <p>but yeah um and Chris as well so just the community outreach and education is is</p> <p>one of the best ways that we can do this for those um communities where</p> <p>eradication is no longer possible but one of the other things that we're working</p> <p>on is really um working with landscape companies and also with the military</p> <p>contractors to um integrate the green waste management and requirements for hot</p> <p>composting of the green waste afterwards um and one of the um so we don't have a</p> <p>there's only one facility on Guam that's um licensed for the hot composting but</p> <p>all of the military green waste is required to go there um but actually making</p> <p>that available to the public is is something that um would be very helpful and</p> <p>just getting those hot composting facilities available um for uh residents to bring</p> <p>in their green waste so that they're not creating more breeding habitat for crb</p> <p>would be very helpful um another thing that our division chief for biosecurity has</p> <p>been working on with um the emergency response teams here in gu is getting the</p> <p>hot composting and green waste management um integrated into our Disaster</p> <p>Response plan so after typhoon Mawar came through last year that was a big issue</p> <p>is that the um green waste collection sites were placed um right next to the</p> <p>port which is the high pressure area for or risk area for escape of crb from</p> <p>Guam to other islands and so figuring out with the emergency response teams in</p> <p>each island uh where those green waste collection points going to be located and</p> <p>situated after a natural disaster is really helpful and so that's something that</p> <p>our um Department of Agriculture is working on now that's so great like so many</p> <p>great Solutions and and lessons that we can bring over here and I'm definitely</p> <p>seeing some of that already happening here on Oahu um I think we should move on</p> <p>to the next question but again panelist and even folks attending if you have</p> <p>thoughts or ideas on these questions just answer put put them in the chat so it</p> <p>can be recorded um Christy I'll shoot it back over to you all right would you um</p> <p>I I'm going to skip to what is the recipe um if we know it yet for an</p> <p>eradication I know small population early detection um but we've had so many</p> <p>learning points along the way uh what's going to be the recipe for the next</p> <p>early detection or maybe it's going to be on on the big island anybody want to</p> <p>take that one this is Aubrey um yeah I'd like to address that um so I was really</p> <p>surprised about this uh learning that Maui has a potential eradication that's</p> <p>happened this year that's fantastic because the only other one that I know of</p> <p>about was on a very small island belonging to Tonga called Kepple Island and that</p> <p>was done way back in the 1930s there have been many many eradication attempts</p> <p>since then I mean if your island is invaded by rhino beetle you've got to</p> <p>attempt eradication for sure but it's it's not impossible but highly improbable</p> <p>with the the tactics that we have currently available um I I'd like to know if</p> <p>anybody knows what's happening on Majuro you know Majuro got hit by rhino Beetle</p> <p>last year now majo is about half the size of Kepple Island there's a real</p> <p>opportunity there to eradicate to learn something about eradication it's only a</p> <p>single flight from an Honolulu to Majuro um that could be a really good</p> <p>interesting testing ground uh and is there anybody here that that knows what's</p> <p>happening on Majuro I I've kind of lost track of what their U their success rate</p> <p>is or what's happening I actually just had um some pictures shared on WhatsApp</p> <p>from the team in Majuro yesterday so um they're doing periodic surveys and</p> <p>searches again for breeding sites on so in Majuro the initial find was there was</p> <p>a collection of a crb adult found on the on the ground at the airport in Majuro</p> <p>just like 20 feet from a CRB panel trap so it wasn't in the Trap it was just on</p> <p>the ground and then the very next day they went out and they found the um</p> <p>breeding site um which was about a mile down the road from the airport and since</p> <p>then they've had a response team that goes out and does uh periodic searches so</p> <p>every breeding site that they can find they destroy um yesterday Kavin was</p> <p>sharing um images of their catch from a breeding site they found and destroyed</p> <p>yesterday so they have another survey right now the crb and Majuro are still</p> <p>concentrated in that one to one and a half mile radius from the or actually west</p> <p>of the airport um it hasn't had made it to the east side of the airport yet um</p> <p>and so it's still concentrated in that area and so they are still doing periodic</p> <p>searches for or regular searches for the breeding site so they are making a dent</p> <p>and they're keeping it contained thanks Andrea that's good news that they</p> <p>are making some progress um do you know who's funding that project um I'm not</p> <p>sure with all of the who all of the funders are they have some emergency funding</p> <p>from the RM RMI government government but they also have support from FAO from</p> <p>United Nations and then also from uh US Forest Service and a few other partners</p> <p>so I know like myself and then um your technician from Guam have gone out there</p> <p>for technical assistance as well as some of the team from Hawaii have gone out</p> <p>Mike Melzer was there um and um Ryan so um I'm not sure and then also experts</p> <p>from India funded by FAO were there to support um and I believe also M Mark</p> <p>Arrow who's unfortunately left couldn't stay for this panel I think he also was</p> <p>there for technical assistance yeah I'll just chime in I was there for the micro</p> <p>games and prior to that uh our our other land grant guys are helping out on the</p> <p>ground with extension with their Bureau of Agriculture and they initially got</p> <p>the traps out from from Roland I just had a hul with them to set that that</p> <p>buffer area and it's interesting because they have set winds so we when</p> <p>after talking with some of the fishermen they started setting up the traps in</p> <p>areas where the winds are going to take home so it was a very interesting</p> <p>Community component too do you know if anybody's check the islands that are on</p> <p>the north side of the ATL yes we set up uh ground traps out there with pheromone</p> <p>LS um and within the quarantine um Ministry or the quarantine division they're</p> <p>they're making monthly checks sounds like a lot going on um thanks so much</p> <p>that's a really good conversation I hadn't heard any of those updates from majo</p> <p>so thanks to everybody for for Lending expertise and knowledge on that um yep go</p> <p>ahead Chris I just want to ask Aubrey could you explain more of the what</p> <p>happened on that small island and how they eradicated the beetle yeah uh it's so</p> <p>it's a small outer island of Tonga called Capital Island that's not his real</p> <p>name I can't pronounce the real name um and it was about twice the size of no</p> <p>smaller than Rota smaller than Rota I think he said 16 square kilometers yeah 16</p> <p>square kilometers which is a tiny Island uh so they got infested and um there</p> <p>was an old German guy living there and he says I'm I'm going to eradicate this</p> <p>and they knew about sanitation you know they they knew about the grubs and the</p> <p>adults um so he got permission from the chief to use as much Manpower as he</p> <p>needed so for seven years period they they scouted the whole island uh found all</p> <p>the breeding sites destroyed them when they found them and uh the beetle went</p> <p>away it was eradicated took a lot of effort and a long time and that's a tiny</p> <p>tiny Island surely with our knowledge and tools that we have available these</p> <p>days we can do a better job but I think um you're going to be luckier on smaller</p> <p>islands like Majuro for sure and then maybe Rota Rota is a good place to to use</p> <p>as a test bed as well yeah I think key that the cultural leader was involved</p> <p>so he got the community initiated and with the technology if we can bring the</p> <p>community and the students and fuse that into one sort of um I want to call it</p> <p>education because it has all components that was that's what I was mentioning</p> <p>before integrated approaches because that is effective and now we've Maui with one</p> <p>effective so if confuse those things I think it'll be working across the islands</p> <p>yeah this is great um I do want to move on to the next question but yeah Teemo I</p> <p>see your hand up just really quickly you know I am biased here but Aubrey and</p> <p>the rest of team I'm curious what you guys think I've been to Majuro there's a</p> <p>lot of coconut trees but not too many what if we treated every single tree in</p> <p>Majuro Via drone would we feel like that might what would eradication anybody</p> <p>estimated the cost of that it probably wouldn't be that much I mean there just</p> <p>fly along the island it's about 30 miles long but it's just like it's just the</p> <p>width of a road basically yes speaking to some of the Regulators over there I</p> <p>don't think that pesticides are an option that will fly with either The</p> <p>Regulators or the populace and I think that's going to be the biggest barrier</p> <p>and Keith may I ask why that is is it because of the crop production and the</p> <p>agroforestry culturally I'm curious I I think it's uh a a just uh pesticide</p> <p>hesitancy probably for a number of reasons human health and ecological concerns</p> <p>probably yeah I'm really a proponent I think for the idea of Evergreen given</p> <p>that it's a it's a product you know used for organic food production um it's</p> <p>still a pesticide in in name but in action it may be something different and and</p> <p>Dr Jenkins has found some fantastic usage for that so thank you so every is a</p> <p>pyrethrin it's a pyrethrin and then the Cyber cypermethrin is a pyrethroid it's an</p> <p>artificial pyrethrin and by the way this cypermethrin is not a very strong</p> <p>pesticide it's the same stuff that they put in Raid that you spray in your</p> <p>kitchen it's got a very very low mammalian toxicity but I know a lot of people</p> <p>don't like using pesticides at all it's just getting Community buy-in yeah the</p> <p>pyrethrin you can actually use in a food processing plant this is great yeah this is</p> <p>touching on some of the concerns people have expressed with um you know edible</p> <p>foods and and spraying products on that so I think there's some great case</p> <p>studies in here I don't know if they've all been compiled together but just</p> <p>bringing these Minds together into one session I just see like all kinds of</p> <p>great products that can come from these conversations um I do want to move on to</p> <p>we have a lot of questions and we're definitely not going to get to them all um</p> <p>but one question that came up into the chat and I know this is kind of the other</p> <p>hand of it you know what it does it take for eradication and what do we do when</p> <p>there's you know crb is widespread and established in these islands and it's</p> <p>circled back to biocontrol so specifically with Hawaii what is the barrier</p> <p>to more research on the fungal and viral biocontrol or even other</p> <p>classical biocontrols and Keith I think you're kind of answering some of that</p> <p>but it' be nice just to have uh concise response and if other folks want to um</p> <p>assist with answering that that would be great yeah in Hawaii there's a lot of</p> <p>interest and I think almost everybody wants the biocontrols I think the the the</p> <p>biggest barrier is that there's um legitimate fears that there could be</p> <p>unintended consequences so some safety testing is appropriate and legally</p> <p>required and uh even the containment for the testing is a difficulty so having a</p> <p>um facility that's suitable there's not a a a facility that Regulators are</p> <p>accepting as um adequate containment but there are efforts underway now to get</p> <p>both short-term and long-term uh increasing capacity for that containment and</p> <p>testing for biocontrol so hopefully that that will happen soon but we don't have</p> <p>a date on when that'll happen but every everybody's interested and thinks that</p> <p>particularly the nuda virus will hopefully be a real game changer for crb it's</p> <p>just a matter of of time and effort thanks Keith CH so this yeah goad yeah yeah</p> <p>um so I've worked on on BI control of rhino beetle for the last 15 years uh</p> <p>first of all we we introduced the the metarhizium into Guam and we use it as</p> <p>a classical biocontrol agent and it it spread very rapidly throughout the</p> <p>island and it's still there it's it's has some effect on the population but not</p> <p>that much but the uh historically the virus has been that the sustainable</p> <p>long-lasting relief from Rhino beetle damage you know for 30 years there was no</p> <p>spread of the rhino beetle because the populations on on new islands was being</p> <p>kept down by introductions of of the virus so the advantage of of using</p> <p>biological control um agents is that they reproduce so you put it into the</p> <p>population once and if you're really lucky if you have a good candidate it will</p> <p>reproduce and spread by itself maintain itself in the population sometimes</p> <p>forever it kind of reinstates the balance of Nature and the uh the big the nice</p> <p>thing about biocontrol agents is um many of them are species specific or close</p> <p>to being species specific so there is no non-target effect um and with the Rhino</p> <p>beet virus with OrNV human populations have lived in the presence of this virus</p> <p>for eons if if you're living in a native uh coconut environment uh there's</p> <p>probably rnv there because almost all of the populations in the native areas um</p> <p>have a high load of of rnv so even though we failed to find an ORV which would</p> <p>help us control the beetle OrNV I haven't given up on that I think it's just a</p> <p>matter of uh you know matching the right isolate to the beetle that's on Guam um</p> <p>so that that's my my take on it I I think rnv is going to be the long-term</p> <p>sustainable solution uh I want to ask a question it's sort of a combination of</p> <p>um several questions that have come up in in the chat uh and that is um maybe</p> <p>this is targeted a little bit towards Matt you know you you talked about the</p> <p>challenges of finding um those chemical lures to to make a more efficient trap</p> <p>um siby trap um so are there things you still want to try and I guess another</p> <p>question um was that have you have you tried looking at the opposite have you</p> <p>tried looking at repellent or has anybody yeah so um I can't speak</p> <p>authoritatively on whether uh you know what other people have tried and isn't in</p> <p>the literature but um at this point I don't know of of people trying things that</p> <p>are repellent um uh and I think that they tend to be a little harder to use um</p> <p>yeah I mean folks picked up on the on the thing and I you know we had </p> <p>multiple people talk about the fact that um uh compost is you know seems to be</p> <p>so much more attractive and that's actually from the bioassay that we conducted</p> <p>that seems to be the case um I think my concern there is how much different is</p> <p>it from the background um and if you've got a you know lots and lots of coconut</p> <p>trees lots and lots of compost out there um can you can you use that um do I</p> <p>think we can make a better mouse trap yeah sure um I think we can um and yeah</p> <p>that's I think probably looking at compost looking at some of the the the um</p> <p>coconut Associated volatiles um are something that would be that would be a</p> <p>possibility um like I said we um I did I tried to stay away from the chemistry a</p> <p>little bit but there are this molecule has two different forms </p> <p>and we're putting both of them out there at the moment so a left-handed and</p> <p>right-handed version um and there's really not been a lot done to see um does</p> <p>the beetle care about one versus the other and there are a lot of insects that</p> <p>do um they like one and they don't like the other and so um there are some</p> <p>possibilities there so some things that are that are possible I'm not sure that</p> <p>it is going to be this the Silver Bullet I don't think that this is something</p> <p>that we can trap out and that's I know I'm I'm I'm influenced by Aubrey on that</p> <p>um I think a lot of what we can do to make this better um are the traps um uh</p> <p>and the lights um those are things that I think are probably lower hanging fruit</p> <p>um but as a chemist like you know I'd love to get in there and see if there are</p> <p>some things that we could do or continue to do the work um uh and seeing if we</p> <p>can improve the lore yeah Mahalo is there a day three just for discussion</p> <p>because we're already at our time right the problem with chemical control is you</p> <p>got to disperse the material you got to get it out there and that's a big</p> <p>problem with this pest because on many of the islands it's not an agricultural</p> <p>pest primarily it's not found just in plantations it's found throughout the</p> <p>environment so you got to cover very large areas basically the whole island like</p> <p>in the case of Guan there's coconuts all over the whole island um you can't they</p> <p>used to spray the whole island they did it for uh for malaria and Deni after the</p> <p>second world war you can't do that anymore but what you can do is you can put</p> <p>out these little beetles that have been had a dose of virus uh and you just let</p> <p>them fly around and and pretty soon they'll cover the whole island spread virus</p> <p>throughout the whole island and you got uh sustainable biocontrol going on and</p> <p>to some extent that's what's happened with the the metarhizium many of the</p> <p>breeding sites that we visit there's already metarhizium there and prior to us</p> <p>getting the beetle we didn't see any any metarhizium on the island uh we</p> <p>actually brought it in from the Philippines and released it thanks Aubrey um</p> <p>we're so lucky to have you still still how much you love your work and still</p> <p>participating so we're feel very lucky to have you in these conversations um</p> <p>this was a great conversation obviously need a whole another day I'm going to</p> <p>push it back over to Franny and the planning team uh because I think we're</p> <p>pretty much at the end to close it out a thanks Chelsea this I really enjoyed</p> <p>this uh part I mean all of it was so good but really hearing this back and forth</p> <p>and it really feels to me although I I don't want to do this to us Elliot Keith</p> <p>Andrea but I I don't think this conversation is over I think there there might</p> <p>be uh future for us to bring folks back together again um but uh it's just such</p> <p>great information and and I I really want to thank all of our presenters because</p> <p>you had so much to share not just in your presentations but in this session here</p> <p>and I just feel again there's just more knowledge I think that is out there that</p> <p>we really um could get gain so much uh with future conversations on this so so</p> <p>thank you all um I want to thank all of the folks who attended I know it was it</p> <p>was really tough to to sit in front of your computer for a few hours and try to</p> <p>engage with all this information but I can tell by the questions that have been</p> <p>coming in that people have been engaging with this information at a really high</p> <p>level uh we have recorded all these questions if your question did not get</p> <p>answered it is not bye-bye so what we're going to be putting together a</p> <p>Communications document and we will be sharing that with the the panelists and</p> <p>and following up and then we will um share some information out along with the</p> <p>full recording of both days uh probably next week to everyone who is registered</p> <p>so that everyone will have an opportunity um to you know hear these</p> <p>presentations again go back check on anything you missed because I know I have</p> <p>to do that and um also following up with that Communications document which will</p> <p>capture a lot of these questions and a lot of the the answers that we get from</p> <p>our panelists so once again just really appreciate that team anybody else have</p> <p>anything they want to add Before We Say Goodbye for for this year Randy you</p> <p>folks um you folks broadcast this to the YouTube channel and it will be</p> <p>available there yeah and and yesterday was a little a little snipped off at the</p> <p>beginning but we will share out the zoom that has Aubrey's full presentation</p> <p>from yesterday a huge thank you to everybody this has been amazing and</p> <p>definitely want to continue the dialogue so thank thanks again to everybody okay</p> <p>Mahalo Hello nice to see you again Aubrey catch you in pi </p> </div>

            <div class="abstract">
                Oryctes rhinoceros is an important pest attacking young oil palms in South-east Asia. In Malaysia, in addition to well-known breeding sites it is able to multiply in shredded chipped old oil palm trunk material in replant areas, also in empty fruit bunches. The aggregation pheromone ethyl 4-methyloctanoate is produced by males of O. rhinoceros (also by the similar pest O. monoceros in Africa), and is used in traps as an important component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and in ecological studies. In Malaysia, the incidence of endemic entomopathogens can be increased. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is available for use as a biopesticide against immature stages in breeding sites and may be distributed by adults. The molecular and ultrastructure of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) has been extensively studied. It kills larvae and is disseminated by adults. New PCR techniques may enable reliable estimates of the quantity of virions in experimental dosages ingested and hence of the virulence of different isolates. It is possible one isolate when released may out compete another.

            <div class="abstract">
                Coconut, oil, and date palms are important crops in the tropics and are attacked by dynastids that cause loss of production or death of hosts. Knowledge of their breeding sites has been extended since a previous review in 1980. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has potential as a biopesticide against immature stages in friable breeding sites. The molecular biology and ultrastructure of Oryctes rhinoceros Nudivirus (OrNV), disseminated by adults, have been studied, and this pathogen can reduce O. rhinoceros populations and damage when introduced into new locations, especially where damage had been high. New PCR techniques may enable reliable quantification of dosages ingested and hence virulence of different isolates. Male-produced aggregation pheromones have been identified in several species, for which they may have management potential, having been used commercially for trapping O. rhinoceros in oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, and tested against O. monoceros in Africa.

                Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a pestiferous beetle causing severe  damage to coconut and other palms by boring into and feeding upon the crown tissue. Several  tools are used to manage this beetle, including pheromone lured traps and the biocontrol agent,  Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). The pheromone lure, ethyl 4-methyloctanoate, was  assessed for its attractive ability towards the CRB-S and CRB-G haplotypes by comparing the  distribution of the haplotypes in non trap-caught and trap-caught populations collected from  Palau. A diagnostic qPCR assay was designed to detect OrNV, and was found to be a more  sensitive and accurate method for OrNV detection compared to the conventional PCR assay.  Finally, because the newly emerged CRB-G haplotype has acquired resistance to OrNV, RNA  extractions were sent for high-throughput sequencing to discover other viruses present in O.  rhinoceros. Three sequences were discovered to be similar in sequence to viruses of other insect  species.

                The restriction endonucleases, BamHI, EcoRl, HindlII and PstI, cleave Oryctes baculovirus (strain PV505) DNA into 21, 43, 23 and seven fragments respectively. A large number of these fragments were cloned into the bacterial plasmids pUC8 and pBR328. These clones encompass 96 % of the genome. The restriction sites for the four endonucleases were mapped using double and partial digestions of cloned fragments as well as hybridization of labelled fragments to Southern transfers of cleaved DNA. When HindlII fragment D and BamHI fragment D were hybridized to Southern transfers six regions containing reiterated sequences were found. The physical map for Oryctes baculovirus could not be orientated with respect to other published baculovirus maps because the BamHI fragment F of Autographa californiea nuclear polyhedrosis virus which contains conserved polyhedrin gene sequences common to occluded baculoviruses did not bind to Oryctes baculovirus DNA.

                Twelve geographical isolates of Oryctes baculovirus were cloned in DSIR-HA-1179 cells. The DNA of these isolates was analysed by restriction endonuclease digestion with the enzymes BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII and PstI. Each isolate showed slightly different restriction fragment electrophoresis profiles. Most of the changes were due to small insertions or deletions of DNA, although two isolates lacked a single restriction site. The sites of genotypic change were not randomly distributed but were mainly associated with regions that have been shown to contain reiterated sequences.

                Public attitudes toward invasive alien species management (ISM) and trust in managers’ ability to effectively manage non-native species can determine public support for conservation action. Guam has experienced widespread species loss and ecosystem transformation due to invasive species. Despite Guam’s long history with invasives and efforts to eradicate them, we know little about the sociological context of invasive species. Using focused group discussions, we explore public attitudes toward invasive species management. Respondents expressed support for management activities and a desire to participate directly in conservation actions. Participants also expressed frustration with government institutions and lack of confidence in managers’ abilities to control invasive species. Perceptions of managers’ trustworthiness, communication with managers, and positive personal experiences with managers were related to positive attitudes about management and support for existing initiatives.

            <div class="abstract">
                The movement of plant pests and diseases from one continent or country to another bypassing physical boundary is as ancient a menace as the drift of people themselves. Many of these species pose a direct threat to food security with progressive socioeconomic perils affecting the livelihoods of people. The National Plant Protection Organisation of a country is vested with legislative powers to prevent the incursion of such species through the implementation of proactive measures such as risk assessments, monitoring, surveillance and controlling human-aided pathways. The unfortunate event of an unwanted incursion brings with it challenges of early detection and immediate implementation of eradication measures which are further compounded by capability gaps and funding constraints. The success of eradication is more than often determined by quick execution of appropriate emergency response measures and flexibility to scale operations when needed. Even with extensive and exhaustive eradication efforts applied, many-a-times the National Plant Protection Organizations face unfavourable results. Coconut is an extremely important subsistence as well as an economic plant for almost all island nations in the Pacific. In this view, existing transboundary pests of coconut in the Pacific Islands basin, namely Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle-Guam biotype, Coconut Lethal Yellowing phytoplasma and the Coconut Cadang-Cadang viroid pose more than a significant threat to countries free of these pests and which have put regional National Plant Protection Organizations on high alert.

                The research focuses on the detection of the most destructive coconut pest- Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) - using image processing, deep learning neural networks, and geotagging technologies in the Philippines. The coconut industry contributes 3.6 percent of the country’s annual gross value. This could be managed using pest control and monitoring technologies based on artificial intelligence and Geographic Information Systems. The proposed system, running on Android 10 or higher, used image processing using a deep learning neural network for pest detection and Geographic Information System for visualization. The model used 15 epochs and approximately 3000 image datasets with a 7:3 ratio to reach at least 94% validation accuracy to be considered ready for deployment. During deployment, the 48 MP resolution recorded the highest accuracy with 91% and works best during sunny weather compared to 12 MP and 25 MP resolutions. Meanwhile, the gathered Euclidean distance of the proposed system from the actual coordinate ranges from 6 meters to 272 meters and has a significant weak positive correlation with the upload delay at a 0.361 correlation coefficient. Overall, the proposed solution has a satisfactory rating for functional suitability, performance efficiency, usability, reliability, maintainability, and portability based on the design specification and addressing the objectives aligned with the key stakeholders who will be using the system.

                <p>DNA analysis in Malaysia revealed several distinct viral genotypes with different virulences. The most virulent for larvae and adults (type B) was produced in vivo and released into healthy populations. Examination of beetles from the release site and vicinity demonstrated the spread and persistence of type B with concomitant reduction in palm damage (Ramle et al. 2005). Decreased control has been reported from other earlier release sites. Jackson et al. (2005) reported considerable genetic variation in the virus that suggests its rapid evolution. They recommended a renewed coordinated effort for the selection and distribution of virulent viral strains. Earlier work by Zelazny et al. (1990) showed some distinct differences in virulence among strains of the Oryctes virus. Marschall and Ioane (1982) demonstrated that re-release of the virus could result in an increase of the infection rate with a reduction of palm damage. The combined use of the fungus M. anisopliae in larval breeding sites and release of virus has also been proposed (Young 1974, Marschall &amp; Ione 1982), but the fungus does not ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

            <div class="abstract">
                An account is given of the history and the results achieved by the U.N.D.P./S.P.C. Rhinoceros Beetle Project in the South Pacific. The special features of the rhinoceros beetle coconut palm system are reviewed as they influence and determine the research methods and the possibilities for pest control. The beetles' habit of burrowing into breeding sites and into the coconut palm crown, together with the low value of the crop precludes the use of insecticides for control. Biological control agents must be able to penetrate these living places in order to be successful. The success of the Project is attrib- uted to the discovery and use of a baculovirus. Its success in reducing beetle numbers preceded the research on its ecology and safety and also curtailed other research direc- tions. The virus is supported in integrated pest management programmes by the fungus Metarrhizium anisopliae and by plantation sanitation.

land Resources Division Pacific awareness and response to the coconut rhinoceros beetle project um or that's the the program that he works with and so if we can get Mark's presentation CED up Franny and I will turn this over to mark good morning everyone and thanks uh Andrea for the the introduction uh as uh yeah Andrea has introduced me I am Mark hero I'm with the Land Resources Division of the Pacific Community and I look after the coconut rhinosaurus Bal project within uh within the uh the the division so just before I proceed with the uh the presentation this morning uh part of the uh the results that I will be sharing with the uh in the in the in the presentation uh will be from a joint uh project that we are carrying out in Van to so I just wanted to initially acknowledge donor uh partner uh which is mfed uh and also our collaborating partners uh AG research and New Zealand uh as well as the the Ministry of Agriculture uh and Forestry uh in V War I uh and also at I'd like to uh uh take the time to thank the organizing committee for inviting me to uh run through uh this presentation uh so basically for my presentation I've uh been asked to just give uh an overview of the situation uh within the Pacific uh the or the Pacific region as a whole uh and also say some experiences from the uh the management efforts that we uh carrying out in Van 2 next slide please okay Jo so just as a background uh uh the the ination of cab within the region is not a new issue uh we add uh the Incas as early as the 1900s uh and as uh indicated also by some of our uh presenters earlier the first ination was in uh 19 9 uh that was into somewh to some uh ported seedlings that were imported in from sria I think salon at that time uh and uh yeah that established within Samoa and then spread uh throughout uh the other neighboring Pacific Islands uh and also we had a second uh sort of invasion or detection that was picked up uh uh during the uh uh the time of the second World War uh and that was in palao as well as the gazel peninsula area of uh of PNG so that was the the the the second uh the two sort of indications uh that we had within within the region uh next slide please okay so this uh this map just basically shows the the incs that we had uh and the the corresponding is that they were detected from uh the various uh Pacific Islands so so the first one uh into Samo and then into the neighboring Islands uh and then uh uh the second detection in palao uh and and the New Britain area of uh of PNG next slide please uh so in terms of the uh ear uh Incas I think this was uh also said in uh uh in O's presentation uh earlier uh but this uh this is 1973 in Fiji uh and this was the kind of damage that was uh detected uh but I think the situation uh uh improved once the the new virus uh was uh uh discovered from its uh native range within the 1970s uh and then d withed uh around the region uh at that time next slide please uh but then I think uh yeah the next uh the current uh uh inversion that we have now is uh of course the the population or the app type that is resistant to the uh the c um as also this was uh uh uh uh highlighted in detail uh the initial detection uh uh within the region that was in 2007 uh from around the tumon bay uh area in Guam uh but since then uh the the this the population the resistant population has been uh detected uh from a uh a couple of uh or uh quite a number of uh uh the Pacific island uh countries and territories now uh which we'll look at in the next uh sorry uh could we go back yeah okay uh so the other thing I just wanted to highlight here is the last bullet point uh the concept of uh the resistant to the vir virus uh was already highlighted uh earlier uh in some of the the Publications uh that were from the the Philippines from the uh the mives as well as from uh Indonesia uh so it's not uh really a new detection that that the uh the resistant population has uh had already existed within the native range uh so I think yeah yeah not to uh take also here is uh if we had to look at the natural enemies uh then uh that may be the the region that we may need to to look at within the native range next slide please so the recent uh indication just repeat of what was detected uh uh from the or what was the situation uh from the earlier uh ination similar damage uh this photo is of uh the 20 uh of from 2022 in V Vu uh just cause exactly uh the same kind of damage that was caused by the uh the initial uh Incas of of the BTO next slide please okay uh this timeline was uh shared by auy earlier uh and he had explained the situation but the uh the information I just wanted to highlight uh from here is that the the earlier ination uh which is uh yeah uh which is with within the the two uh lines the the P lines uh that's the earlier indication uh and in terms of the I just wanted to highlight in terms of the spread uh or the the spread of the the spread or the the uh The Invasion within the region it took a longer time uh for the Bol to establish uh where else if we look at uh the the current indication that's between the uh the orange uh lines uh the spread is quite rapid uh and uh yeah the spread and the EST establishment is quite rapid so uh we are looking at at a situation where they are spreading much much faster uh than was the situation uh with the earlier inion uh and uh yeah we are thinking that may be attributed to the uh more the improvements within the uh with with the uh uh the mode of transport and then uh the movements between uh the islands uh in terms of uh the person or the in terms of uh human movements uh as well as uh equipment uh so uh that could be attributed to to that next slide please okay this is this table I just wanted to highlight uh the in terms of the proximity I think yeah of the uh of the initial detection within the individual countries that we've uh that that have been picked up uh and I think the the last uh column which may be of uh importance to note uh so the earlier DET in uh the the ex sites have not been really uh confirmed uh I think basically because they were detected uh when they had already uh spread further uh within the countries of detection uh but with the current uh detections uh we are able to pick up where exactly they have been picked up uh and they are more the the the areas of initial detection are more relating to sort of international movements uh so yeah the the the GU one is of course highlighted by uh by oy it's within wedding chapel uh but the awai I think that was also highlighted by Keith in his presentation as well but it's also uh yeah within the vicinity of the International Airport uh and then uh for the uh rnm i1 I think it's within the uh the Alba area as well H and for PNG uh we have both that the Russian detection uh of the population that is uh related to uh uh recent population that is uh resistant to the virus uh was also uh picked up from an Hotel uh that's next to the airport uh and then Solon Islands uh it was picked up from within an area uh where the uh the Pacific uh Festival of Arts was held uh to two years earlier uh and then van 2 uh the first because they both the virus susceptible as well as the resistant population uh the uh the one that's uh susceptible was picked up from a village and it was suspected that uh there were some s Aggregates that were brought indirectly around there from an infested uh country uh and also uh the the virus resistant population has been picked up from uh around uh the uh the WF area the international W uh and the new calonia is also related uh the initial detection was close to the international airport as well so I think there's some link uh in terms of the movement and the spread uh of the beetle uh throughout the the region okay next uh slide please so this is just the the summary of what it is uh at the moment so we only have about eight of the Pacific island countries and territories uh that are free of uh CB uh most of uh uh the uh the pigs or the yeah the the the the countries and territories are now uh invaded by CB and some of the uh uh the countries or territories have both uh the susceptible and the resistant population uh while uh some of them have uh either of the the population so that is the situation at the moment uh and uh the Bol is is continuing to spread so we may uh if they continue to do so uh those remaining ones may have the bols uh in just a matter of time uh next slide please so I think looking at the the current situation that we have at the moment uh in terms of the spread of the ble we really need to have a holistic Regional approach to uh the management uh efforts that we have uh across the region otherwise I think at the moment we are working in silos uh and if we uh do that uh my view is that the the ble will continue to spread and we are also uh concentrating all the efforts uh within the countries uh that have the ble and for those that uh do not have the ble uh in terms of their uh their preparations monitoring surveillance uh we sort of uh we are not uh giving uh uh much attention to uh them so I think we need to so the the Bal has the chances of continuing to uh to spread into those those countries uh that do not have it uh so we uh yeah we really need to have an holistic approach uh and then looking at assisting those uh countries to prepare for any and have uh prepare for any potential ination uh and have a uh have a more uh a an active monitoring and surveillance program in place and there is also the potential of uh reation into the countries uh if we concentrate on uh uh on uh on uh on countries with the the Bol and then uh uh and and uh in isolation and contend a bit all the chances of reation uh is there as well I think that's the case that we've uh seen for some of the countries which only at one of the populations uh and then I been the other uh the other uh the other population uh coming into the country uh and just in terms of the uh in terms of the management I think yeah we could this way also touched by uh some of the presenters earlier in terms of what we can do uh to do uh in terms of the management programs uh but I think yeah in some areas we can uh look at the eradication uh I'm just thinking in terms of the smaller uh islands and where the population are more confined uh I'm thinking more of RMI situation as well as cnmi if uh we want to try eradication then maybe those are uh the the islands that we can try and look at uh but in situations where they're more established and we look at IPM uh and then for those that uh already have the or do not have the the ble as I indicated earlier the monitoring and surance uh program is uh uh is uh is critical uh and also the other thing that's uh yeah not given much attention is the uh the internal quarantine within the countri as well uh we are nations of Island so uh once they get into one of the islands the others remain free of the vle of the vle and we need to also look at supporting with internal quarantine to uh prevent any potential uh spread within uh within the countries uh themselves as well so yeah so what what we basically need is that the responses uh need to be tail according to the situation next slide please okay so that's just the C uh General situation about uh uh about the the situation of cab within uh the Pacific uh I'll just now have a look at uh or run through some of the uh the management program that we've uh rolled out within uh within vanu uh so the initial indication was on F which is the the one with the big uh red uh Circle uh and the beol uh that was in uh 2019 uh and the beol was confined kept uh on on on E until more recently where it has been uh picked up from uh Sando uh just up on the uh up on the North at the bigger map where the small circle is uh so that was uh just detected more recently uh in uh in around uh June here next slide please uh and uh these are just uh some pictures of the level of uh damage that we uh picked up in in one2 uh next one please and uh the damage uh were not only on uh only on coconuts uh but that's also indicated by uh the other presenters for uh for Hawaii as well as Guam we picked up damage on onal Pals as well as on uh food crops like the pineapple year next slide please so in terms of the uh the management approach I think we we really need to uh look at it uh through an integrated approach I think uh uh a single uh uh approach uh won't solve the the problem uh because of the uh the kind of or the the the uh the situation with with the pesto we really need uh uh a uh an integrated approach to effectively uh control the ble uh so we were looking at the awareness uh also internal quarantine uh there was also a program looking at Cas for vetal sanitation uh metalism Fon uh and uh the virus as well uh as an integrated approach to containing the BTO uh next slide please so just in terms of the awareness I think uh yeah I might add that there was a lot of uh training uh that was done to the team as well uh because the the the Bol was new within uh the country uh we had to run a lot of awareness programs uh both Community as well as general uh public awareness programs uh and also provided a lot of uh Technical Training to uh the the the team and there was also some U casual engagement of uh staff that were involved uh with the program so we engages uh engage uh staff as well next slide please okay uh another program that's uh more an inititive of the uh the the the local national uh government uh uh within one I uh was the uh the internal uh quarantine uh uh program that was uh put in place as soon as the CB was detected uh there was a ministerial order uh that was put up uh and uh for for vessels uh uh not to live in the night uh from uh a f that were going into the other islands and basically from one or two the M coconut growing uh islands where uh Santo and molecular which is also next to it uh so they didn't want the beetle to get there uh so they had that uh ministerial order in place uh and within that order uh they asked for the vessels not to depart after 400 p.m. uh and also did a full vessel and cargo inspection before d uh and also at all the lights of uh when overnight in at the wolf uh and for vessels that at light Z on there was also night operation uh to inspect the the vessels uh to see if there was uh uh any B that were around the vessels to for for them to uh to remove and kill at the next morning before the vessel left there was also an inspection uh down to the vessel uh next slide please uh and then just in terms of uh the uh the results within the last uh year the the last couple of uh years uh where they they inspected more uh more than 50 vessels uh and so up they detected around about uh 20 crb uh there was seven males and females so yeah there were females that were detected so if they had spread then yeah you would have active uh breeding that would have uh taken place uh and there were numerous ported plants that were checked as well with some uh some confiscated if they were suspected of containing C uh immature stages and uh yeah the other Target Islands particularly the two remain uh free of CB until um yeah the recent detection in Santo uh so that the situation with that operation uh and next slide please okay yeah cash for B that's also the local team's uh initiative uh they just wanted to see if the the community uh would respond H and then bring in the be or collect the be uh and bring in uh to we and then get paid uh for uh so through that program just ran for uh only about uh four months and then within that period uh yeah close to almost uh 20,000 uh Beetle uh stages were uh were collected within that period so there was a substantial amount of uh our only concern where was people breeding the B uh for uh for for that uh but uh through a lot of awareness uh uh the communities local communities were advised and they've also seen the impact of the program so and there was a lot of beetles for them to collect from the wild uh to bring in so they they they yeah whatever that was brought in was uh brought in from the those that were collected from the W uh next slide please uh and there was uh lot of uh sanitation program that went do it uh so collection of The Beetles and then uh the dead coconut PS been fell uh and then uh and B uh so yeah and also indicate I think earlier sanitation is the critical component uh once uh pals are killed and uh The Beetles continue to breed uh in then they the population continue to increase uh and then you just flow and effect affecting the healthy uh PS within uh within your area of infestation uh next slide please uh yeah the other thing was uh metrium application and infection uh so we uh uh we build up a unit uh that's uh yeah that's given in there uh where we had the the box that was built and then we had organic meta uh and just below the uh the organic meta there is a collection uh uh collection uh bucket that's uh below the PVC pipe uh and there is also up at the the top of the PVC pipe uh cut at opposite sides for a beol to come in with with a firmon on the top and then the beetles come in and then e the side of the PVC pipe and then drop into the Container uh for us to retrieve and kill uh so we had one system that was for both the metum application uh as well as the uh the feron trapping uh and uh yeah so we had those organic metal that were put within the Box were initially also mixed up with metm before applied and then there was a monthly application that was done uh and also check for uh potential infection uh and we got a good infection uh within the uh the boxes and we also picked up uh uh infection within the the surrounding area so uh which is indicated that uh the metm has been uh spread within the natural breeding sites uh next slide please so these are just some of the summary of the uh the infection data that we picked up mainly from the artificial uh braining side it's it's quite low but uh I think in a way it contributes to uh the management effort as we also get in the spread of the the MATC in within the natural uh breing sites uh and next slide please okay and uh yeah the fmal traing as I indicated uh it's also part of the uh the metrium application unit as well uh and this is we we mainly use the PVC pipe uh with the collection uh collection backet at the bottom to collect uh the The Beetles that get R and then uh the idea also is that uh those BS that miss the uh uh miss the uh the the the PVC pipe uh and get dropped uh they can e a breed within the organic metal be there and then pick up the metric uh for infection next slide please and uh yeah these are the numbers uh that we collected over the the last uh yeah two two and a half years uh yeah almost just over 16,000 uh Ms de where tra uh in in the font traps uh next slide please uh and then uh I just wanted to very briefly highlight on uh this effort as well uh yeah our cabor a research is also was also able to work on the the virus as part of the uh the the rear uh and uh they've uh done preliminary fil releases uh and we are at this stage getting some positive results from the establishment within the field uh next slide please uh and uh yeah also just wanted to uh iight here that as much as possible we kept away from uh the insecticide use uh mainly due to the safety ISU for the contact uh spray of contact insecticide due to uh I water table land uh water table we we decided to uh sort of limit that and also at the same time uh for the TTI uh the residue issue it's really impossible to monitor any potential impact on humans collecting uh the nuts and having them so uh we just kept away from uh the insecticide application and then just concentrated on uh the other management effort uh next slide please so that's yeah I'm almost there now that's our last uh uh you yeah second last slide uh but uh just wanted to it's still early days uh but we are seen signs of uh recovery from uh on the pals in the areas that we've uh uh We've uh applied the management uh programs H and we are hoping that uh the pals will continue to recover uh over time and then we can uh effectively also uh suppress the the population of crb through the effort uh next slide please and yeah I think yeah it's needless to say that I mean it's it's also uh important to highlight that uh those uh efforts were not with challenges so I just wanted to highlight some of the key challenges that we had uh we lost almost uh about two years of our activity to covid-19 uh due to travel restrictions and lockdowns of the of the program uh and we wward to also at uh a number of uh disasters natur disasters particularly the Cyclones that went through that also yeah met the situation was in terms of the Palms that were uh that were killed uh for for for potential breeding uh and also uh the biocurity uh or the internal uh uh vessel inspection program uh that was uh uh that was implemented also at its opposition especially from The Vessel uh operators uh because it affected the the program so there was opposition uh but with a lot of awareness it was eventually understood and we had also had some vandalism issues with the setups from uh local communities okay yeah and on to the last slide please I should finish off soon and I think the last slide I just uh this uh Roland has sort of very well highlighted the importance of uh coconuts uh to us in the region uh but as also been someone from within the Pacific region as well uh I just wanted to reemphasize and finish off Yeah by saying that uh cogat is pretty much everything to us uh it's a way of life and it's a a tree of life uh and as much as possible we just need to uh protect the the coconut uh from from uh those anything that that uh would cause the the damage to it including the the CB and I think that's that's it and thank you very much Andrea than thank you so much Mark that was a lot of great information um I we are ahead of schedule uh so we do have some time for questions for Mark uh if anyone has there's already some that are uh some questions and comments that were going on in the chat while you're while you were speaking but if anyone in the audience would has a question we do have a few minutes if you could just use the zoom button to raise your hand uh let's see we have one person is this R ranu from uh I think from from Marshall Islands did you have a question your hand is up okay are we able to is he able to I think in this format we may not be able to have them talk so I think it probably if you have put questions in the chat or the Q&amp;A box okay all right so there uh we had in the chat there was some inform some discussion and questions about the omv uh resistance of the crb in Hawaii um oh let's see um Mark you had a a slide in your presentation that um um indicated that the Hawaii crb are resistant to the biocont control virus and there was some um discussion in the chat about that do you are you able to elaborate on how you know that the crb in Hawaii is resistant to the virus okay yeah if uh the Hawaiian team has uh it is no comment to make there that they they can do that but uh from the information that we have is uh that the population is related to the Guam one and I think the Guam one is also from uh uh Aubrey's presentation that they've tried the virus and then it is resistant to the virus uh so I think that that yeah it is it is uh uh it is resistant to the virus and I think there was some uh Yeah Yeah from the molecular work that was been done it is related to the uh to the population in in uh uh in Guam so uh that's way we are thinking it is resistant to to the virus okay if as I say if if the the Hawaiian team has some other information then yeah yeah that yeah can't provide that yeah I think there there's um our next speaker also will kind of address that and then uh I know we've got some ongoing projects to examine that uh more closely with field testing uh for rnv and the crb and Guam um and I think there will be other opportunities during the Symposium to talk about that um there was another question uh whether there are any parasites uh I'm trying to find it again um um where is this uh are there any parasites for example parasitic wasps that Target crb and that question is from William Steiner is is this anything that you have knowledge about Mark okay uh yeah W with respect to the uh yeah the work on uh uh on on uh on parasitoids as well as uh the Predators the has been uh a lot of work that was done with the initial uh Incas of the uh of the of the ble within the region uh that covered uh both the the region uh as well as uh the native ranges and there was extensive extensive uh um search for other uh uh biocont control agents including the uh the parasitoids and as well as the the Predators uh test were done within that time but most of them were uh were found not to be to be effective and I think from that uh that uh initial study uh the two promotion uh candidates that came out were the the matricium the fungus uh and the and virus which were also soured from the native range within in in in in Malaysia uh so those were the ones that were actively used and then uh uh so I think in terms of the that's that's the similar situation at the moment with the the current uh in Invasion that we have thank you um there's one other question that's com in from the chat Mark um so and this question is is it possible to use IPM on infested Islands to have long-term suppression of crb or should we expect a long-term decline coconut trees over time giving current suppression tools that's a that's a tricky one yeah yeah it's a decision on whether you want to let your coconuts go or you want to protect the Coconuts so if you do really want to protect the Coconuts on the islands then you'll have to go through the IPM to manage the ble uh otherwise if you leave it then you lose all your all your cook nuts uh and then you you may have to uh but then then we we've noticed that they now have the alternative p uh alternative host as well uh in terms of breeding as well as uh feeding uh so it can lead to other food security issues as well so uh I would think that you really need to to control the V and get a population down um yeah I think that that is true and you see in um some of the islands like even in Guam we've had the beetle it's for uh oh 15 years going on 20 years um and yes our our coconut trees look bad in some areas it's worse than others but overall we still have coconut trees 20 years on almost 20 years on um and you know this this Guam you know is in one of those situations where we don't have other predators that uh like birds that can help suppress the the crb PO population but other Islands do have those Predators um that can um feed on the the crb and I think it's hopeful for other Islands but you will see also in Guam we have brown tree snake and uh since the birds are gone because of the brown tree snake the the tree snakes that are remaining they're switching to other food sources so um they are smaller but the um the snakes are still here unfortunately but they're no longer as numerous or grow as big as they did previously um so there Island to Island they'll have to make their choice of and uh understand what's available on their Island um and I'm just looking I think we we have about two minutes left in the schedule I don't know if this is um if we have enough time for one more question uh I don't see another specific question I think we have to move on okay yes so thank you Mark so much for all the information and for um responding to some of those questions before and great work uh for uh everything that you're doing with Pacific Community and um I would like to take this time now to </p> </div>

            <div class="abstract">
                Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus which has been used as a biocontrol agent to suppress coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) in the Pacific Islands. Recently a new wave of CRB incursions in Oceania is thought to be related to the presence of low-virulence isolates of OrNV or virus-tolerant haplotypes of beetles (CRB-G).

                Oryctes nudivirus (species OrNV) has been an effective biocontrol agent against the insect pest Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) for decades, but there is evidence that resistance could be evolving in some host populations. We detected OrNV infection in O. rhinoceros from Solomon Islands and used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing to determine the full length of the virus genomic sequence isolated from an individual belonging to a mitochondrial lineage (CRB-G) that was previously reported as resistant to OrNV. The complete circular genome of the virus consisted of 125,917 nucleotides, 1.698 bp shorter than the originally-described full genome sequence of Ma07 strain from Malaysia. We found 130 out of 139 previously annotated ORFs (seven contained interrupted/non-coding sequences, two were identified as duplicated versions of the existing genes), as well as a putatively inverted regions containing four genes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of a long-read sequencing technology for resolving potential structural variations when describing new virus isolates. While the Solomon Islands isolate exhibited 99.41% nucleotide sequence identity with the originally described strain, we found several genes, including a core gene (vlf-1), that contained multiple amino acid insertions and/or deletions as putative polymorphisms of large effect. Our complete annotated genome sequence of a newly found isolate in Solomon Islands provides a valuable resource to help elucidate the mechanisms that compromise the efficacy of OrNV as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle.

            <div class="abstract">
                Recently, incursions of the Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros, have been detected in south Pacific countries that were previously free of the pest. It has been suggested that this range expansion is related to an O. rhinoceros haplotype that is reported to show reduced susceptibility to the well-established classical biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). We investigated O. rhinoceros population genetics and the OrNV status of specimens collected in Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and the Philippines. Based on the sequence of the mitochondrial CoxI gene, we found three major mitochondrial haplotype groups (CRB-G, CRB-PNG and CRB-S) across the region. Haplotype diversity varied between and within countries and a high incidence of OrNV infection was detected in all haplotypes wherever they occurred. The O. rhinoceros population in some countries was monotypic and all individuals tested belonged to a single haplotype group. However, in Samoa we detected CRB-S and CRB-PNG and in Solomon Islands we detected all three haplotype groups. Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) showed genetic differentiation in the O. rhinoceros nuclear genome across populations on different islands and provided evidence for gene flow, resulting in a well-mixed population, despite the presence of different CoxI haplotypes in Solomon Islands. Evidence of admixture was also detected on both islands of Samoa. The current CoxI based method is not a reliable diagnostic marker for phenotypic traits, especially in countries such as Solomon Islands where the mitochondrial haplotypes have come back into sympatry and are mixed. To identify possible mechanisms of resistance to OrNV, further molecular analyses O. rhinoceros in response to virus infection is required. To improve biological control of O. rhinoceros, such analyses will need to be combined with an improved understanding of the population genetics of the pest and the evolutionary history of OrNV in the region.

                Over the last few years, various types of NGS data have been accumulating for the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB, Oryctes rhinoceros), reflecting the growing interest in curtailing this invasive pest of palm trees. Whilst reference-free analyses of RNA-seq and RAD-seq datasets have been done for different CRB collections, recent availability of the CRB’s genome assembly provides an opportunity to collate diverse data and create a reference-based population dataset. Here, I release such a dataset containing 6,725,935 SNPs and genotypes called across 393 individual samples from 16 populations, using the previously published raw sequences generated in 9 different experiments (RAD-Seq, RNA-Seq, WGS). I also provide reference-based datasets for the CRB’s mitochondrial variants and for variants of its viral biocontrol agent Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus. SNP data provide high resolution for determining the geographic origin of invasive CRB. With these genomic resources, new data can be analysed without re-processing the published samples and then integrated to expand the reference datasets.

                Background The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB, Oryctes rhinoceros ) is a severe and invasive pest of coconut and other palms throughout Asia and the Pacific. The biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), has successfully suppressed O. rhinoceros populations for decades but new CRB invasions started appearing after 2007. A single-SNP variant within the mitochondrial cox1 gene is used to distinguish the recently-invading CRB-G lineage from other haplotypes, but the lack of mitogenome sequence for this species hinders further development of a molecular toolset for biosecurity and management programmes against CRB. Here we report the complete circular sequence and annotation for CRB mitogenome, generated to support such efforts. Methods Sequencing data were generated using long-read Nanopore technology from genomic DNA isolated from a CRB-G female. The mitogenome was assembled with Flye v.2.5, using the short-read Illumina sequences to remove homopolymers with Pilon, and annotated with MITOS. Independently-generated transcriptome data were used to assess the O. rhinoceros mitogenome annotation and transcription. The aligned sequences of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) (with degenerate third codon position) from O. rhinoceros , 13 other Scarabaeidae taxa and two outgroup taxa were used for the phylogenetic reconstruction with the Maximum likelihood (ML) approach in IQ-TREE and Bayesian (BI) approach in MrBayes. Results The complete circular mitogenome of O. rhinoceros is 20,898 bp in length, with a gene content canonical for insects (13 PCGs, two rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes), as well as one structural variation (rearrangement of trnQ and trnI ) and a long control region (6,204 bp). Transcription was detected across all 37 genes, and interestingly, within three domains in the control region. ML and BI phylogenies had the same topology, correctly grouping O. rhinoceros with one other Dynastinae taxon, and recovering the previously reported relationship among lineages in the Scarabaeidae. In silico PCR-RFLP analysis recovered the correct fragment set that is diagnostic for the CRB-G haplogroup. These results validate the high-quality of the O. rhinoceros mitogenome sequence and annotation.

                Pests have different effects on crops production in the country's agriculture where most of it is negative depending on the type of pest. Pests consume the nutrients reside on the leaves, trunks, stems, branches or roots of the plant or tree which is required for the crops to produce more and good quality crops. The main intention of this project is to create a device that detects early infestation of three types of pests in coconut trees naming Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle (ARB), Coconut Leaf Beetle (CLB), and Coconut Scale Insect (CSI) using Raspberry Pi camera and sensor embedded on a drone. Furthermore, this project produces useful data about what kind/s of pests are infesting the coconut trees which will be beneficial to farmers for they would know what approach is appropriate to the issue.

Many researches have been conducted on its development, life cycle, habitat, management and genomic variation ever since the need to understand this pest arose. Oryctes rhinoceros is among the longest present agricultural pest in Malaysia and it has witnessed the formulation and implementation of various phases of control and management strategies. To date, research and development activities are still ongoing in Malaysia for the successful management of this pest. In this review, we look into details on the characteristics of this pest, the modes of its introduction into Malaysia, as well as the events that helped to establish and contribute to the proliferation of this pest as a major oil palm threat in Malaysia. The progressive development of various research and development activities concerning the management and control of this pest are also highlighted.

                any forest-defoliating Lepidoptera exhibit long-term cyclic fluctuations in density that span several orders of magnitude. One hypothesis to explain these fluctuations is that they are driven by pathogens with long-lived infectious stages capable of surviving outside the host. The basis of the argument is that, for realistic parameter values, a mathematical disease model incorporating such an infectious stage is likely to show cycles with the same period as is observed in nature. The mathematical model used to make this argument, however, is so simple that it may not be biologically meaningful. In this article, I extend the original model by including two realistic complications: density-dependent host reproduction and host movement behavior. Including density-dependent host reproduction greatly increases the likelihood of cycles; addi tional realism thus strengthens the original conclusion. Including host movement behavior makes the model more versatile, as it allows comparison of the model output with literature data on the spatial spread of insect viruses. This comparison suggests that the spatial spread of the viruses of Gilpinia hercyniae and Oryctes rhinoceros can be explained with a very simple model of host movement, without recourse to complicated mechanisms of dispersal. The introduction of host movement behavior also introduces the possibility of cycles of outbreaks in space and time simultaneously-that is, waves of disease that will reappear at regular intervals.

                It is suggested that the isolates of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV), cultured for decades in cells of Heteronychus arator (F.) (HA), be checked to verify genomic changes have not occurred which adapt them to culture but reduce or cancel their ability to infect the target pest, the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros (L.). Full genomes of field-caught OrNV isolates, and their infectivity against larvae and adults, could be compared with those of HA-cultured isolates. Further data to correlate OrNV dosage indices with doses in number of virions/ml could be advantageous so as to explore if CRB larvae or adults may resist infection by a sub-threshold dose. Also the possibility of changes in the HA culture cells which alter the outer coat of the resulting virion, hence perhaps its infectivity towards CRB cells, could be checked. Might it be possible to move beyond HA-culture and develop tissue culture of Oryctes rhinoceros cells for mass production of OrNV as this beetle species is the target? Nuclear genomes of OrNV-resistant and OrNV-susceptible strains of the CRB could be examined for changes perhaps correlated with resistance. The possibility of endosymbiotic bacteria affecting CRB susceptibility to OrNV might be checked.

                Climate change is expected to have a significant influence on species range expansion, habitat shifts, and risk of biological invasion due to changes in survival rates, and rapid reproduction. This will tend to affect their geographical distribution and dispersal patterns, thereby threatening agriculture production and food security. Therefore, it is essential to understand the impact of climate change on the range shifts of an invasive species like the Asiatic rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Dynastinae: Scarabaeidae), to inform policy formulation and preventive measures. To achieve this, we used environmental variables and occurrence records of O. rhinoceros to predict the current and future potential distribution of the pest under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) for three time periods (2030, 2050, and 2080). We employed Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) and ArcGIS to create risk maps for the pest. The BRT model predicts an expansion of O. rhinoceros outside the current known distribution. The environmental variables which contributed the most to the geographical distribution of the pest were minimum temperature of coldest month (26.81 %), followed by precipitation of wettest month (20.61 %), temperature annual range (11.34 %), mean diurnal range (11.33 %), and elevation (4.49 %). Under the different climate change scenarios, O. rhinoceros will continue to threaten the economically important host plants until 2080. As a result, there will be a need for effective strategies to prevent its spread. Our predictions are reliable and have the potential to estimate the global distribution of the pest, as well as provide suggestions for prompt of O. rhinoceros prevention and management.

                The rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros L.) is the primary pest of oil palm plants. Rhinoceros beetle pest attacks cause severe damage to immature and mature plants. They produce an aggregation pheromone identified as ethyl-4-methyloctanoate (E4-MO). Rhinoceros beetles use this pheromone to find suitable habitats for foraging and breeding in the landscape of oil palm plantations. The mass use of pheromone traps has been used to monitor and capture imago stages of O. rhinoceros in the implementation of integrated pest management. Many commercial E4-MO pheromone products have been developed on the market with different packaging designs. The research aimed to determine packaging designs that increase attractiveness and effectiveness in catching rhinoceros beetles. The research was conducted at an oil palm plantation in Indragiri Hulu Regency, Riau. This research was an experimental method. The four design pheromone (permeable sachet, micropore sachet, tube dispenser and double dispenser) were installed in each oil palm planting block (planting area ± 30 ha/block). The number of installations for each design is three units/block with five replications. The assessment of rhinoceros beetle catches was carried out over four months. The results showed significant differences in the catch of rhinoceros beetles. The 4th month of observations showed that the double dispenser packaging design resulted in a higher total catch of rhinoceros beetles, with an average of 161.40. Meanwhile, permeable sachets, microporous sachets, and tube dispensers were 138.20, 139.80 and 91.00 beetles, respectively. Determining the pheromone packaging design is crucial to providing an effective and efficient pest management strategy.

            <div class="abstract">
                The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros, CRB) is a serious pest of coconut and oil palms. It is native to South and Southeast Asia and was inadvertently introduced to Samoa in 1909. It has invaded many other Pacific countries throughout the last century. Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), a natural pathogen of CRB in its native range, was successfully introduced as a classical biocontrol agent and has effectively suppressed invasive CRB populations for decades. However, resurgence of CRB has been recorded, with new invasions detected in several Pacific Island Countries and Territories. Additionally, new populations of CRB are emerging in some invaded areas that have a degree of resistance to the virus isolates commonly released for CRB biocontrol. Here, we designed a fast and reliable tool for distinguishing between different OrNV isolates that can help with the selection process to identify effective isolates for management of new CRB invasions. A comparison of 13 gene/gene region sequences within the OrNV genome of 16 OrNV isolates from native and invaded ranges allowed us to identify unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). With these SNPs, we developed an assay using multiplex PCR-amplicon-based nanopore sequencing to distinguish between OrNV isolates. We found that as few as four gene fragments were sufficient to identify 15 out of 20 OrNV isolates. This method can be used as a tool to monitor the establishment and distribution of OrNV isolates selected for release as biocontrol agents in CRB-infected areas.

                <div data-schema-version="8"><p>2024-09-12_Hoffmann_transcript.txt</p> <p>very minuscule looking deep deep into DNA um and we're gonna go way broad for the next uh section of today and be looking at biocurity and intersection interceptions and um movement of crb uh and how we can interrupt that movement and detect we've had a lot of information today about how uh the be is moving or may be moving across the Pacific and we know there's still a lot of places um that are not infested like I like to consider the island that I live on not infested so um how do we prevent those areas from becoming areas that have to deal with CRV so really grateful to everybody who's here today for that and we're going to start with uh I think a colleague of teches there Dr Ben Hoffman who is principal research scientist at ciso health and biocurity uh from the tropical ecosystems Research Center in Australia Ben if you'd like to uh start sharing whenever you're ready and we'll be very interested to hear what you have to say it's brny hi everyone um and you just confirmed that that's showing properly Yep looks great excellent so hi everyone for those who don't know me I'm Ben Hoffman I'm actually an invasive ant research but I dabble in all sorts of biocurity matters and over the last few years CB has got my attention and what I'm going to talk about today is a paper that's literally just come out this week myself and some colleagues um about biosecurity interceptions um of coconut rhinoceros ble and this came about I think because one day I was just pondering what are what do the data look like for uh this species uh of the biocurity interception and I think I was what I had in mind was Australia is still free of this species and so we really do want to know this information if we're going to uh keep that status and when I went to search for the information I couldn't find it anywhere and it looked like nobody had published on it before and so that started a quest to try to find that information and uh in doing so I ended up with a couple of collaborators uh and we've now come out with this paper now I got to work out how to change the slide there we go so the the primary places we went looking for were the biocurity databases databases of locations that do regular inspections so it's very well Quantified um and we managed to get this from four databases one being Australia with two decades of data New Zealand also two decades of data uh the European Union and Switzerland which is about 15 years and from us defense um the contractors doing cleanliness inspections uh of goods being moved out of and into Guam and Roa of course we wanted uh as many as we could get but there were a few that we couldn't access and an example of that is the BIOS security database of Fiji they do have a really good one uh but we um uh couldn't access those data for whatever reason and and we also know that there are inspections happening in places but there's no particular database for it and an example of that is um the Guam civilian ports so to extend our data we also did um General web searches and in particular we found one publication uh Kumar and bsby it was a pest risk analysis uh of us ports uh intercept data um about 15 years up to 2014 and we also found Publications that had four more interception records and at the end of the day we had to draw the line somewhere and we pretty much exhausted our searches at this point but we decided that it was sufficient to give um good insight into what's happening with CB I want to be very clear exactly what we didn't do we didn't Focus um our um a gathering of data on the reps of exit we weren't really concerned about where the BS were coming from and partly because we didn't want to make this into a political document uh because there are issues for for trade um and so along those lines we also didn't do any risk assessments um so that those are that that's a completely different science that somebody else can do so what are we found we got 52 uh confirmed intercepts uh for the two decades for New Zeal Zealand they got it 13 times in Australia for two decades they found it 14 times in Guam since 2017 it's been found twice uh and from the USA up to 2014 it was found eight times at ports we found no credible interceptions from the European Union so there were beetles reported um but it was typically just something like arus spit and so we discounted those and there were four intercepts reported from two other jurisdictions now the only picture you're going to see in this presentation this is what that all looks like uh cumulatively so the bottom sets of um patterns there are the the major countries they individual data and then the top one is all of that combined and what you can see is there's a pretty constant rate of in interceptions regardless of whether you're looking at a jurisdiction or at the global level there might be something interesting happening there at about 2009 there does seem to be a little bit of an acceleration uh but we couldn't ascertain anything from that I maybe that's a good point for somebody else to look into uh in the future but otherwise it's pretty constant we then looked for any patterns through those data uh that could help for bi security and unfortunately there really wasn't much at all um all but one of the detections were adults and of those that were sexed they were pretty even sex ratios um in terms of month of detection there was no seasonality found in any of the detections predominantly from the Australian data which included month of detection most of the beetle St were alive and so these beetles were capable potentially of inducing new incursions and maybe there's a story from New Zealand with their interceptions from the Philippines what we found is that there were regular occurences from the Philippines this is the one and only case where I'll mention the source um and then it suddenly stopped and there hasn't been an interception for something like well over a decade from the Philippines in New Zealand and we actually contacted the New Zealand authorities to ask if there was um something a protocol put in place to um make this happen and unfortunately nobody knew the answer and I suspect that there probably was but the people have moved on but in any case there is another very interesting thing for somebody to look at uh with these data to work out why New Zealand is no longer getting these beetles when they were in the past probably the more concerning thing is that the detections were associated with a very broad array of Commodities or situations so here is the the list of things that they were were found in I'm not going to go through them but needless to say they were found in um all sorts of vessels including an aircraft cabins and and the hold and their wheel wells um all sorts of um prod uses uh and even concerningly a fair few were in the uh aircraft passenger luggage this is just in their their bag with their clothes and with a bit of investigation with this it was clear that they weren't people weren't deliberately bringing the Beetles um into places where they were going to The Beatles were literally somehow getting into their luggage so what does all of this mean well unfortunately crb appears to be an extremely generalist passenger and it's capable of being accidentally transported by a wide variety of means literally at any time and what it means is that there's pretty much no possibility of us focusing on any particular commodity packaging vessel season Etc um to uh detect this species and it's simply going to come down to really good B security vigilance on all goods and vessels arriving at and leaving destinations and that's it thank you very much wow that was Fant that was fantastic thank you so much ben I'm I feel like I'm learning so much um from these talks and um one of the things that has been a really big deal for us is trying to figure out which commodity we really need to focus on and obviously you know everyone green waste and mulch but you know from what you're saying it's really there's a lot of potential weak points that we need to be highly Vigilant about and that's very helpful information um so Laura Brewington says in the comments crb in the close no thank you I think we can all get behind that um I'm trying to see if there's any questions that we want folks folks want you to answer right now um slides that Mark showed of the The Beetles literally flying onto the uh the ships at at night time and the the number of interceptions there that's scary knowing that the Beetles are just flying onto the dexed ships and the ships are moving on and going elsewhere that the amount of vigilance that is going to be required to stop an incursion occuring like that is just incredible yeah I think that really Echoes back to Mark's presentation this morning talking about you know how much uh security they're trying to take with those ships moving at night and and they have to turn all the lights off you can't you know have any lights on if you're on the ship and I mean that is is a really difficult level of security to maintain and kudos to anyone who's who's able to do it that's a lot of work um uh christe is saying great talk and did you report on living slot living and I think I did see that on one of your slides how many Beetles you were finding Dead versus alive unfortunately so high risk of starting a new incursion sorry that you faded out a little bit at the beginning there what did you say correct so they were mostly alive mostly alive okay that is that's upsetting honestly um okay let's check our time right I think we want to move on actually we do have some time if anybody else has a question okay see Aubrey has his hand up yes I do and I do have a question and a comment um I have some uh records of interceptions which aren't on your database my question to you is are you going to curate a database uh ongoing or is there a way of doing that no uh but in the paper uh We've provided a summary table of everything that we found so that could certainly be a basis for that fantastic yeah I'll get in touch with you about that um just of Interest the the there's two interceptions On Sian which is um an island just north of Guan and one of them was a beetle that that was caught there a year before it arrived on Guam so that was an early warning sign and the second interception was actually when uh several pallets of soil packaged soil were shipped up to sipan and they were full of grubs and adults and then there's the Mexico uh interception as well which you probably know about yeah thank you very much that was really interesting stuff yeah it was and I I see another comment um someone's commenting I think this is from your Dan your presentation yesterday that some lights actually repel crb so um my gosh another layer of complexity what type of light are we talking about and some attract some repel um very problematic very problematic uh thank you so much if anybody has any more questions please go ahead and uh post them and be sure to stay tuned I hope you'll stay with us then for this afternoon for our um our panel discussion okay um next up we're going to have Dr Julie Lockwood who is we're jumping to another side of the world from Australia all the way to New Jersey so um Julie is coming to us from Rucker University where she's a professor in the ecology Evolution and natural resources department and she's also the interum director of the Rucker's climate and energy Institute so welcome Julie thank you so much for being here and uh sharing with us about uh environmental DNA I know that's something that everyone's very interested in I see you have your screen shared so you can take it away we're not hearing you though so yeah I know it's like how many years do you do zoom and you still can't unmute yourself but you can see everything okay we can see it it's beautiful thank you okay great thank you so yeah I'm in New Jersey so it's quite late here it's a it's a great uh group of people clearly needs to be virtual since we're doing it from around the world um so I'll talk to you about our work on uh developing an environmental DNA tool for crb and this is a group project with Kathleen Kyle Anthony vastano and an neelson all here at Ruckers so if you're familiar with Edna at all you probably were introduced to it by thinking about um aquatic Edna so H sorry I have there we go aquatic Edna and the idea with all DNA is that anything that's alive is shutting some form of DNA into their surrounding environment and so if you can just then um grab something used to be called bulk DNA but I think it's sort of expanded beyond that but the idea for aquatic DNA is you just need a little bit of water and there's a lot of DNA floating around in that water from all the things that were living around in that water so then you isolate that DNA and you um move move it through sort of pretty standard genetics tools to figure out um what species belong to that DNA so you can sort of grab one little bit of water and tell all the fish in this particular case and so that's kind of how it got started uh it's been moving pretty regularly out of aquatic world and we've been our lab has been pushing it into more terrestrial systems um and in particular with Forest pests or agricultural pests all insects and so we started out using developing this for brown marmorated stink bugs and uh we've been deploying it which I'll show you a little bit later on spotted Lantern fly and lately on Emerald ashborne Asian longhorn beetle and so we thought maybe it would work with coconut rhinoceros beetle so in this case of course you're not going to grab water the DNA that's being left for at least for insect pests is that they're leaving it on their host plants or host trees in this case and the question is how much DNA are they depositing in those areas where on the tree are they depositing that that becomes really important and then how do we access it since we can't just kind of it's not water so you can't just sort of go and grab that so I'll show you how you do that but this is the idea is that we that in this case coconut R rhinoceros beetles are going about their life and they're leaving their DNA around and so if we can uh capture that DNA and move it through the sort of genetic pipeline then we we can confirm that they were there without ever having to catch them so one question I regularly get is how do you know the DNA is from the species that you um say it is and the answer to that is that it that's a good question and we that's a constant sort of um process within the environmental DNA Community is to figure out what part of the genome is best for um attaching to to attaching species to the DNA you get from any one sample so in our case we're not doing multispecies Edna or metabarcoding Edna metabarcoding we're doing a more conservative approach which is using qpcr to identify one species which in this case is the coconut rhinoceros beetle so what we're doing with environmental DNA is trying to find Trace Amounts of DNA which is usually small fragments of DNA where we can say all that series of Acts and G's over that fragment is going to belong to crb and nothing else that Co co-occurs so the first thing that we did was to develop that assay so we used some existing genetic information and then we also sequenced a bunch of coconut rhinoceros beetle beetles as well that were provided to us from our partners including Keith and Mike and some other folks and what we developed was a 64 base pair ampon within the co1 mitochondrial region um if you're interested in using using it that's the sort of you can find it using some of that information but you can also contact us and we'll give you all the recipe and information that you might want to use we tested it both in silico and in situ to make sure that uh that that fragment of DNA that 64 base pair fragment will not amplify in a qpcr machine for any other species um I can't say that for the whole world but I can say it for Oahu pretty confidently so we tested it again against um co-occurring or other um beetles including flower beetles things like that that were common we just also did some collections while we were in the field to make sure that there's nothing that was co-occurring and leaving their DNA around would just amplify in our qpcr and indicate that crb were there when they really weren't so we had no indication that was true we think this assay is um only going to uh report that it you know that in a qpcr machine if it's really crb one of the other standard protocols you use for Edna is to calculate what's called limit of detection and it's just a series of inlab experiments where you figure out how little DNA do you need to have an a sample before you um cannot detect it anymore so these are quite small so we uh uh calculated out that you can detect within a qpcr machine using three technical replicates in a qpcr for those of you who are way into this about 500 50 fogs per reaction and that the lowest concentration you can detect from our from using serial dilutions is around 663 fogs and just as a reminder a fogam is 10 to the -15 G so what that means is that we can detect very very Trace Amounts of crb DNA in any given sample that we take so it's very sensitive and so far at least species specific here's our field methods they're very like you know I don't know people think about Edna they think you're doing something really kind of special outside but really we're just taking paint rollers and looking like we're painting the side of a tree we look a little nuts when we're out there doing it it prompts a lot of questions from the public which has been entertaining but the idea here our original idea which we've used for other species as well is that um in forensic Edna or forensic DNA work they just take a swab and they'll sort of swab a table or something to get the murderer's DNA right and so what we needed was a really big swab to to run across the surface where we think the DNA is and so what we decided to do was just take paint rollers and make those into giant forensic swabs and so what's happening is we of course uh sterilize these before they come out into the fuel to make sure there's no DNA on them and then you just stick them on a roller and you moisten them a little bit and you roll them on the side of the tree um where you think the past insect is likely to have deposit some DNA um you can use one roller and roll two three four trees usually we've done some experiments saying that beyond that you probably are doing more you know you may be losing some DNA so two three four trees with one roller once you kind of done that then you take the roller off put it in a bag sterile bag with some di water and you just sort of clean it off kind of the same way you would a paint roller at the end of the day in your house so what you're doing in that instance is you're taking any DNA that's on that roller and kind of moving it into solution into that water after that we can just borrow all the existing standard protocols for aquatic DNA so for example that last picture is you just take a um oh this late and I remember I can't remember the name of the pump but it's just a pump that pumps out the water moves it across a a filter that collects the DNA and a lot of other stuff that happen to be on that roller and then once that happens then you take that filter in this case these are Smith root filters that are self- desting so you can just put them in a little bag and we can send them to New Jersey if we have to but you can also take that filter out and preserve it and put it in a small tube um say in ethanol and then that's it so the roller doesn't matter anymore and the water doesn't matter anymore everything that you need to know is on that filter from then forward um you can see in this left one is that we were on a golf course uh surveying for this was I think Ted mecena golf course and we just had our whole setup on the back of a golf cart so it's pretty portable once from that once you get the filters you take them back into the lab and you run them through the qpcr machine this is another example of this is stuff we've been doing for the New York State Department of Transportation sort of following the spread of spotted Lantern fly across major roadways um and this is another example of like guess basically the low Tac nature of collecting these things from the field so this is just in the back of a truck and that's pretty much all you need so it's not not too burdensome we'd like to make it less burdensome the other thing we tried was using Eden attacked um the grubs and and mulch so the you could just treat this like a soil sample but there's so much mulch you'd have to go through to figure out whether or not there are grubs there so we tried something else and that's just taking some mulch samples throwing them into one of those bags kind of making mulch tea if you will and then sucking that water out and moving it across the filter you can see the chryst this is way way way dirtier and muddier in terms of what goes on that filter um but it was something we would try because we could get through a whole you know a lot more surface area of mulch by doing that rather than just taking the soil and taking it back it's that's a very burdensome way of doing that so here's where we we did sort of this in two runs and the first one was just to go out to places where um Keith and his crew told us there are most definitely coconut rhinoceros beetles in these two places because we needed to confirm that um if they were there we could attack them and so in 2022 we did this in two locations I the you know my stars are a little off so you can kind of see where they are but it's in the CIA area and then at the golf course um near Honolulu so I'll just cut to the chase there and we could detect them it was not not a big deal so we in in both the mulch and on the trees we could detect crb from our rollers in our little mulch process so the the that confirmed that the basic idea was sound then in 2023 we did what I call the challenge surveys and that's we took we went out and did surveys in areas where there um were much less crb at least in 2023 so some of those places were they know we know it have some trap detections and some places that really weren't or just a few so we're just trying to see how well it performed in areas where there weren't a lot of coconut roseros beetles um the places where there were not a there were not that many of them they performed well we're kind of still working on that data it's tough data because you have a whole bunch of zeros so how do you analyze a bunch of zeros so we're kind of moving on from that and seeing if we can't build that up a little bit better with a follow-up Grant but the one area we could do a straight up comparison between our Edna detections and traps was um in halulu kind of in the northern part of I'm sorry in the other the top sort of um star in in the graph there so we just recently calculated this using detection probability detection uh formulas from occupancy analyses so this is a pretty standard way of dealing with prob detection you including with Edna we have uh the site we needed a site where we had some detections and non- detections all within the same period And so that that kept us in that sort of medium density area you can't have all ones because then you can't calculate anything and you can't have all zeros because then you can't calculate anything so I'll just say this is pretty this is kind of a first Glimpse at what this looks like but it's a limited set of data we really kind of need to build that out what we did was for the site when the one or two days that we were out doing our roller samples and for Edna we pecked um we got trap data from Keith um and the previous two weeks and the two weeks after we were there so kind of a bracketed in a month where we were kind of in the middle and took that trap data and calculated probability detection and compared to that what we got for Edna and the results are that they are they're fairly equivalent they they're giving you the same probability detection so these are the panel traps which I'm sure Keith can tell you a lot more about I believe they're vaded with faon they're all within a kilometer radius of where we took the Edna sample so they're not crazy distant but they're a little bit distant and we're basically getting the same kind of return for what were're in terms of probability detection of crb if they're there um the big thing of course is that we were there for two days and then the traps were deployed we just took the two weeks you know that so that's a pretty big difference in effort The Mulch this is I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on these results except to say that when we looked in the in 2022 we were in the high density areas and we really were trying to figure out whether or not we could get anything with the mulch it's like yes you can detect crb using our methods with our little mulch tea without much problem when they're pretty common but when we challenged it and sort of went into places where they're not that common there's a huge variance in whether or not we would get detections uh that's almost certainly from some low popul low sample sizes but the other thing is that the um you just can't cover as much surface area and the mulch with the way we're doing it as you could with the rollers you can get a lot more sites that might have the DNA because we don't know exactly where that DNA is we're making a guess based on the natural history of crb um any want educated guess but there's just the the DNA that the grubs are um leaving or just stays local so if you don't happen to dig that part of the the pile you're not not going to get the DNA so it's a promising result but I don't know if it's really operational um so I would say you know that's a kind of interesting question about what to do next my guess is it wouldn't be what we did our solution was not the optimal solution but there could be some other things that we could do including potentially using air Samplers so how coost to operational are roll or crb Edna surveys I would say for anything that's truck accessible where you could get a truck or I guess a golf cart out they're ready to go I mean we've been using the same approach in New York state following the dispersal pathway of spotted Lantern fly which is very much along interstate highways and we can this is just a map of all the areas we've covered in about four weeks we can cover a huge area in just a couple weeks from the back of the truck so the efficiency with which you can get to a lot of different areas and knowing that you're getting the same probability detection at least for traps means that I think you could deploy it pretty much immediately um I think it's also ready to deploy and sort of native Force where maybe you don't want to hang a lure um but there are some Logistics things like do you have to pack in rollers and get them out and so there's some preserv DNA preservation issues there that we'd have to do but I don't think any of those are insurmountable the one question that we can't quite get to but hopefully we're going to get some more money here soon soon is to see how well Edna performs in detecting crb when they're very rare at a site so just getting there early detection early early detection and for that one it's there's a lot of um there's a lot of stuff we kind of need to think about we kind of need to interact with folks who know a lot more about what the Beatles do you know where are they leaving their DNA maybe more exactly because now we're talking about only a few individuals leaving DNA so we have to be very precise in terms of where we go to try to quote capture it um what is the behavior of a of a rhinoceros beetle that suddenly finds itself on a new island are they going to immediately go to a top of a of a coconut tree or are they going to do something else because if they go immediately to the top we can Target that area maybe with drones we've been doing some work with using drones and canopies of tree canopies and so that given all the work I've seen in the past couple days on drones maybe there's something we can do there anything we can do to kind of increase the capture probability or the detection probability this kind of gives us a new tool in our toolbox to make that happen and then finally I really really really want to combine uh using pheromones with Edna where the idea here is that and forgive me for my bad PowerPoint things but when a phone trap is luring in a coconut rhinoceros beetle for you to know that it got there it has to encounter the Trap and then get caught in the Trap and from what I know of other insects you know that capture rate is pretty small so if they're hanging around the trees around that uh lure and leaving their DNA then if we just roll those trees around it then we can incre we can effectively increase the the capture rate of the Trap by allowing ourselves to capture their DNA instead of capturing them so I would love to be able to try to um to try that every other insect that we've been dealing with pest insect does not have a great lure so it really was worth trying but what I've heard so far with with SE I think it might really work well so you're just combining fair you might just want to keep the trap out there for regulatory reasons because you need a body if you're going to do anything but um just seeing if you can attract them to the area and then use Edna to to find their I'm sorry to use the rollers to find their DNA so this uh I want to acknowledge that this was funded from the US Department of Defense and their cerit program and this is our group um and I also want to have a huge thank you to Mike melzer and Keith Weiser and his crew because they hosted us and allowed us to send stuff from New Jersey made our life a lot easier for doing that so that's that's it thank you Mahalo Julie that was fantastic and um it generated a lot of questions this presentation lots of questions about uses of Edna I know it's very Cutting Edge so if you wouldn't mind um just checking out what's going on in the chat there and and maybe you can go ahead and and answer some of those questions because we're going to move directly on to our next speaker um but you're getting a lot of claw so appreciate that from everyone um but I really want to move to uh Andrea Blas because she was our our Host this morning and she is our next presenter um and she's the climate change and invasive species Regional research coordinator for the Micronesia conservation trust and also one of your organizers today Andrea welcome back get your unmute and then we'll be able to hear you still muted oh sorry that was my bad um I was trying to sh screen share and let's see if I can get that that screen oh hold on one moment sorry of course the zoom tool Art Is Right on top of where I want to click okay that always I hope Zoom fixes that so at some point it's a more direct I'm sorry so are you able to see my uh presentation screen now yeah I think we are

                The rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) was accidentally introduced into Samoa in 1909 from where it spread to many islands in the south-west Paciﬁc. A novel virus pathogenic to the beetle, originally designated as Rhabdionvirus oryctes and later Oryctes virus, was isolated from Malaysia and introduced into Samoa in 1963. Later releases took place in Tonga, Fiji and other Paciﬁc Islands. The virus rapidly established and caused high levels of infection that spread as epizootics through the beetle populations. The virus killed larvae in breeding sites and caused adult beetles to cease feeding, leading to reduced damage and a decline in fecundity of the pest population. Researchers reported spectacular declines in the treated populations within 1–3 years of application. Reapplication has proven effective where there has been a resurgence of beetle damage. After 40 years from the initial releases, high palm damage has been reported from some areas suggesting a breakdown of control. Selection of more virulent strains and improved methods of application could overcome these problems.

                The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB: Oryctes rhinoceros L.) is one of the most damaging pests of coconut and oil palms in the Asia/Pacific region but has not been reported from the Western Hemisphere. Here, we report a possible establishment of CRB in Nayarit, Mexico, based on an analysis of social media reports and photographs indicating the presence of the beetle and the distinctive v-shaped notches in palm fronds caused by the beetle feeding. CRB populations are destructive once established, therefore, urgent actions are required to contain the pest and prevent damage to coconut and oil palm in the Americas.

                Abstract The infestation levels of O. rhinoceros were investigated in the oil palm trunk heaps in three replanting blocks (Blocks A, B and C) at Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. These blocks had different densities of pheromone trapping: high (11 traps per ha, Block B), normal (1 trap per 2 ha, Block C), while no pheromone trapping was conducted in (Block A. Without pheromone trapping, the infestation levels of O. rhinoceros can reach a maximum density of between 25 to 50 individuals per m2 (IPMS). The O. rhinoceros population was still detected in the heaps up to more than two years (at 26 months after replanting). With high density trapping, infestation levels were maintained below 10 IPMS and was not detected in the heaps after a period of 16 months of replanting. In the normal trapping density, the population was also maintained below 10 IPMS but had sustained itself in the heaps for up to 24 months. The mortality factors associated with the larval stages sampled within these replanting blocks was determined by visual symptoms with subsequent verification with microbial analysis. The analysis was narrowed down to detect only bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis and B. popillae), virus (Oryctes virus) and fungus (Metarhizium). In Block A, the population of O. rhinoceros in the trunks was reduced drastically at 14 months after replanting (MAR), which could be due to the high mortality (88%) of the third instar larvae, 3 months earlier. In Block B, the percentage mortality for the larval stage was always highest at the third instars (between 21-82%). In Block C however, the mortality of the third instars was low, never exceeding 35%. In these sampling blocks, the infection of Metarhizium seem to be less dominant compared to virus or bacteria The k factor analysis indicates density dependence among the third instar larvae had contributed to the change in its population density in Block A. Therefore, with proper manipulation of pheromone traps and targeted application of disease agents (i.e virus,fungus and bacteria), the population of O. rhinoceros can be managed more effectively in an oil palm replanting.

            <div class="abstract">
                A novel Picorna-like virus, tentatively named Oryctes rhinoceros Picorna-like virus 1 (OrPV1), was identified in coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) larvae in Taiwan. The complete genome sequence consisted of 9,665 nucleotides with a polyA tail and included one open reading frame. Conserved structural domains such as Picornavirus capsid protein, RNA helicase, Peptidase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were identified through Pfam domain searches. The genome shares approximately 28% identity with other unclassified picornavirals that infect honey bees (Darwin bee virus 2, Bundaberg bee virus 5, and Sacbrood virus) and a recently reported virus from Asian lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis virus 1). We did not detect this virus in any other geographical populations of O. rhinoceros collected from the South Pacific Islands and the Philippines. Analysis of the deduced RdRp amino acid sequences showed that the virus clustered with other Picorna-like viruses and separated from other members of family Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae.

            <div class="abstract">
                The Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) or previously known as Oryctes baculovirus is a biocontrol agent for rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros. The replication of three types of OrNV, the  types A, B, and C in the insect cell line DSIR-HA-1179 was studied. The cells were grown in PS100 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The signs of infection in cells by all types of OrNV were clearly seen at 10 to 14 days after treatment (DAT). The infected cells experienced cytopathic effects (CPE) involving formation of high number of vesicle or globule like-structures around the cells. The density of viable cells in flasks inoculated by the nudivirus decreased over time. At 16 DAT, the viable cell density in flasks inoculated with OrNV types A, B, and C was 1.49 × 105, 0.29 × 105, and 4.78 × 105 cells ml-1 respectively, significantly lower (P<0.05) compared to control flask of 7.98 × 105 cells ml-1. Based on the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50), it was found that the OrNV type B was more virulent than the OrNV types A and C as it produced high infectious virus particles. The TCID50 values for the OrNV types A and C were 3.00 × 107 infectious unit (IU ml-1) and 8.03 x 105 IU ml-1 as compared to type B which was 7.09 × 107 IU ml-1. The PCR analysis showed that all types of OrNV had successfully replicated in the cells as early as 4 DAT. Pathogenicity study on neonates using cells-propagated OrNV has again showed that the OrNV type B was more pathogenic than the other types of OrNV. The LT50 value for the OrNV type B was 33.47 days, shorter than  the OrNV type A (49.35 days) and the OrNV type C (48.58 days). The DNA profiles of OrNV extracted from dead infected neonates in the bioassay were the same as those from infected gut tissues collected from field population. Thus, it is suggested that the Malaysian OrNV types A, B and C were successfully produced in cell line DSIR-HA-1179.

Community College Cooperative research extension we're so happy to have you Chris uh you want to get your camera on there and your screen screen perfect I don't know if you got my share screen thing there just want to hit the uh presentation mode there presentation mode all right here press the top of the screen is blocking hold on how there we go that it there you go looks great I'm going to keep same with Andrea Connection in our regions a little slow and at that Nexus of climate change we're just having a nice Cyclone cruising through the area so we've had some interesting winds so I'm sure some people so I'll just go over um sort of the history this is a put a kind of throw together of stuff that I've worked on with many many students and eventually with our team here at the college and a lot of Partnerships because we have many resources oh just pressed the button okay everybody I'm sure most people know where palao is as you can see it's kind of positioned furthest west on the the Pacific Islands right above Papa Guin and close to the Philippines and that'll become important later along the kushu ridge looking at um the sort of and at the on the west of the andesite line so I'm going to just go over a quick review of what the vegetation types are so it gives you an idea of maybe where the Coconuts played important roles and how they came in and were used so we have our strand vegetation of course like most of us islands with coconuts where they come over Limestone forests which are they plant some within the old archaeological sites called wet these areas near the Marine Lakes then mangr Forest which are usually just used as a protection area and a nursery swamp and W Forest usually no coconuts lowland forests the riparian forests and the interior Forest which is our primary forest and then there's the Savannah which you call get and that's where the first components of human influence in vegetation come in where there was a slash and bird Community some studies show that there were a lot of palow on there and that's where most of the farming took place and then the ones that exist today which is M and Mos um which people plant coconuts around to use in their daily lives and of course the farm in the SS which is more modern with the topa introduction in during the Spanish times so this is how an Old Village I don't know if you guys can hear me L says I'm not loud enough but uh this is kind of an Old Village rendition you can see the coconut palms around and how the tarot patches and everything were set up so we'll go through the coconut history and plow because I had to go through this when I was first brought on the pre-c contact Spanish German Japanese American um territory T and current so pre- contact obviously we all know coconuts were spread out through all and our ethnobotanical surveys I can't even see my sle slides hold on second so we for language as some ethnographers he anything still and this is the one of the and CA trade with javanes Sailors from Australia through Indonesia and other areas up through to China and Pala was kind of one of that one of those spots along during sort of the Westerly winds times and when there was unrest within the north of Malay Malaysia and this is documented through money be trades and then other metals and cloth that were um seen on palan Islanders during contact with Captain Wilson and other visitors and during the Spanish time cop trade was a little bit more organized but Pala was just the peripheral Colony um where they picked up some of these uh some of the uh cash crops that they brought over to the to the to Europe and then in in the German times and this is also we're talking with my grandmother and some other people um coconut oil became king and as this uh marketing ad from old German uh newspaper says just as palm trees Towers above tower towers above all animals so coconut oil surpasses all animal fats in Purity and quality and this was used for cooking bread when there was no um Refrigeration lasted a little bit longer um but uh palons were sort of forced and this is and ENC or encouraged to increase uh production of coconut so they were planted a little bit further up and and more intense cultivation was made and during the Japanese uh times was the largest uh uh agricultural scale thing in there called yiding which we still use today to talk to to describe these coconut plantations throughout palao so uh C were important traditionally they were used as as seen throughout the islands but it was also economically important to colonizers so things were very well maintained and managed so were the trees and the crops and then we had a nice little war in Pala that uh took out a lot and and um that was I guess that's pelu pretty much ra lot of Destruction but I think the important component with with respect to crb is that there was a lot of debris that was left and um and and for some reason they say that it was first identified here in the 40s and and probably that debris was large the left the leftover debris was the breeding source for a lot of the crb explosion populations and then we had the release of the virus um I guess it 160 and 70s to control and then we had that the crbg I guess we're changing nomenclature but I'll wait for you guys on that so as everyone said as as um we saw in most of the other genetic presentations the native population in Southeast Asia and they mentioned that it was first discovered discovered and I put quotes discovered in the 1940s but that's highly unlikely as we have our own name for it which is and from talking with some of the people on the the east coast of Pala there the lar was actually consumed so it was probably here prior but I guess we'll have to do more genomics and then we've had um some typhoons swam has those Philippines everyone and and this is also a lot of debris but it's also I also kind of want to harp in that we don't really consume as much coconut I think in on the islands as we used to we import more most of our goods and people are buying coconut juice in a box tourism so obviously those were the breeding sites um this leftover debris and then this is like this is what I the students and US started with working at and I called it Picasso designs when we look at the damage on the coconut trees we have a regular Picasso art landscape um in plow and then of course impact can destroy treeses most of these pictures over there are from Guam and sorry Andrea they just had much more damage than us so I didn't have other pictures and we use the SBC method for um for Quan qualitative damage assessments we Quantified afterwards and then okay we'll go in there I'm not an invasive specialist and I am a pharmacologist by trade and uh so the late yel miles um who was in Pala our invasive species specialist requested assistance on PCR work with the here at PCC and we gathered a team of students um and to work on community based research for the project stage assessments as we show above with a no budget so the objectives that we established during this discussion was determine the impct of crb oh sorry and determine um okay so we'll go through that so we set up permanent plots in 2016 in all states um using that method and we've followed through that over the past eight years and the first three years we looked at it was kind of strange because usually were expecting that the damage would increase uh steadily linearly but we had this drop so we thought there was something else going on and as you can see we focused a lot on the outer line um um atol because uh during drought time they wouldn't have any um water supply so coconuts were their main source of hydration so that was Kion but they also dropped at the end and then sunor where um although that the main village area wasn't damaged as as bad um one of the outer Line Islands Pana ended up with zero coconut trees at one point due to crb so we had to um kind of act objective two was collecting samples um well we're very lucky to be working with Mike and of course we got a lot of the the primer um primer uh uh from New Zealand group Shawn and Au and Audrey and and Aubrey Moore was helping did Mike meler came down and and we work with Madoka as well in Japan to get some of this stuff analyzed so we we set these um assessment sites and and surveying sites around the damage sites so that we could have maybe a correlation study and what we found was there was not really a big variation of course this is with the old uh co1 um sequences that we're that we're looking at and of course we could look at them further and the objective three was to determine the incidence of the the virus as well so we had crbg and S at the time that was nomenclature back then this is both from 2016 and then they determined the presence of or NB and we found that a lot of the samples were positive of course there was a um some conjecture that it was a um contamination but was pretty I guess groundbreaking at the time and uh obviously went through and kept doing it and showed some reduction and looked at some gut damage and um as you can see there was the most of them tested positive for RV so there was kind of a strange uh thing at the time when a g was not shown to be in infected by the virus so the summary of that work that was done up to 2018 was the question when Guam type invaded when invaded in palao and again that that theory of it coming in the 40s was I kind of would like to look a little bit further and see that as as um T's presentation showed there was probably a native population that came up through that Indonesian either that or during the initial um colonization of palao and whether the tree damage here was related to G type and we didn't show that at all there was no correlation to that and whether the virus was detected and the virus was not correlated specifically with non G type based on the co1 um so the actionable items um the only thing we can do here with our very limited resources is try to solve problems so as you saw in the beginning the vulnerable Islands were the main focus so that Island in sunso was the main focus because the Coconuts were being completely um destroyed so there was Zero coconuts on that F area and they were starting to hit the pandanis plants as well so what we did was obviously support physical control over there and then uh worked with um Madoka and and she came from Japan to try to see if we could get some isolates of virus that was in PL already and then we uh inoculated some of the Beetles down in Sunol and release them so uh some of the the trees are coming back and that's the same story for a k when those typhoons hit there was really bad damage afterwards because there was not a lot of grein waste clearing so we tried to help get shredders and things up there to manage the green waste and of course some deep ground burning and things like that so the coconut are kind of coming back and we every every time we try to work with a partners of course we're a landr Institute and when I came on board here at the college I said okay there's a huge Network um so we had the land grant people out or I visited a couple places and working with Mike and Guam it's always so disjointed um when we try to get different grants and funding and everything's based on that but what we do have in our region is this regular funding from USDA and and since um apis and all these people are involved in in um uh allowing the release or or biocurity models for we decided to kind of work with this multi-state patch research project so we could officially work with us partners and try to get this on the radar within a a long-term funding cycle so we're kind of in this is a planning stage multi-state project with USDA and we're working on a full research patch project to kind of connect the region and make sure that we can get a lot of the academic components in and I think that the most important is having those institutions so we can continue the research by the students because um we have this rolling every summer for the damage assessments and Collections and this is our next generation of scientists coming in it was uh great to see a young person in yesterday's presentation looking at Food security and the scope of that and we hope to get more of that here we've had some students and we thank Mike for uh taking on Nelson who's I guess now working at Monsanto but we'll try to get him back later to palao and then I guess the discussion uh now is we have to enhance these collaborative efforts I really uh enjoy like kind of bringing together like hearing all the stuff going on because it was so scattered in the beginning it was very hard for us to work especially with very minimal resources in Pala and trying to get the international national Partnerships and get real um capacity here but we're still working on it and um I I have to bring the Nexus in there palal can offer a site for research Nexus uh between the native populations and new population of crb because I think that's kind of what was shown and I think if we get more sample sets over over time we'll find that um there may be other uh virus um or NRV variants that we can work with in the face of climate change because we do have our Cyclones and whatnot here in Guam and the other areas so we can you know key that in and then mainly um what I I try to focus on um without that research component is that it's community based as um the young young I think it was Andrea or Andy who mentioned making sure that the community is involved in the component and it's not a just top- down approach and heavy outside researchers coming in but that it's integrated integrating these modern invasive management techniques to um local practices and traditional ecological knowledge because that'll help move things along quickly as I showed earlier we didn't have that problem till after the war when the Pal's population went bu to around 3,000 um so kind of I'm hoping that we can bring back that to EK and integrate it with our new methods so I just want to thank you this is the student team that was 15 minutes right that was awesome thank you so much that was really interesting to hear that having it been interwoven with that human history and how much that has influenced you know the way that the coconuts have been used and not used and you know things changing and how that might interact with the beetle I think sometimes we have a tendency to remove humans from the equation but we're always in there and we have to take ourselves into account um if folks have any questions for Chris Chris I see a couple of questions in there I think that uh people it's other panelists just asking other panelists but if you want to go ahead and and respond to anything that's coming up if anybody out there either on uh YouTube or in Zoom has any questions for any of our panelists that we've heard from this morning please go ahead and uh ask those we're we're keeping a very comprehensive document so even if we don't get to these questions at the end of the day today we are going to try and get these to our panelists and um at the very least inform um the questions that our researchers are trying to answer um we do have a short break before we move to the next um session so please feel free to get up stretch your legs in fact I'm going to tell you to do that it's a really important thing to do I'm gonna turn off my camera and do that in a second um and get yourself some water and stay hydrated and I'm going to launch a poll as well if you already participated in the poll yesterday not necessary to do again but for those uh who weren't on the zoom um and anybody who's on YouTube that was unable to uh participate yesterday please go ahead and and just tell us where you are uh and uh share with us your experience on working with coconut rostros Beetle just give us that that range from never to a lot um and I'm going to go ahead and turn myself off here and take the break and uh just get at that poll when you have a chance e e e e e e e e hi everybody we are in the home stretch of this inaugural crb science Symposium thank you so much for joining us and we're moving into our last session on day two um hope you had a chance to answer the survey questions let us know who you are where you're coming from which helps us to understand who is making use of these these webinars um in our last session which will'll be moving to in just a minute uh we're going to have a talk and then we're going to have a question and answer session so as Franny mentioned please uh add your questions to the Q&amp;A um to the chat uh in both Zoom as well as YouTube live and uh we'll do our best to get to some of those questions uh in our our Q&amp;A session to to finish this off at the [Music] end and with that uh as soon as our next speaker uh is ready and feel free to to jump on turn your video on and I can introduce </p> </div>

            <div class="abstract">
                Coconut production in the Pacific Islands is threatened by coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB). Distinctive feeding damage caused by adults is often the first indicator of CRB activity in a new location. Multiple approaches to damage assessment have been used, reflecting observers’ experience. The lack of standardisation makes it difficult to compare CRB impacts on coconut palms over time. We examine damage assessment from three perspectives: participants, power and purpose. Participants applied binary, 3-point and 5-point damage scales consecutively to photographs of damaged palms. Participant responses were more accurate using the binary scale compared with the 5-point scale. Experience with CRB improved accuracy, but this did not wholly compensate for the effect of scale complexity. Calculations of statistical power determined minimum sample sizes to detect a 20% change in palm damage was 50 palms for the binary scale, 150 palms for the 3-point scale and > 200 palms for the 5-point scale, when the change in damage was spread across damage categories. More complex damage scales did not increase the likelihood of detecting significant changes in palm damage. With real-world examples, including detecting new outbreaks and managing established populations, recommendations were developed to standardise damage assessment for CRB on coconut palms.

                Guam’s established population of non-native coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB, Oryctes rhinoceros L.) began creating burrows in stem apices of several cycad species in a managed garden. We conducted an island-wide survey to determine the spatial patterns of CRB burrowing of stems of in situ Cycas micronesica. We also measured starch of healthy and unhealthy coconut leaf tissue and compared this with starch of cycad stem tissue. The starch concentration of the central unexpanded leaf in healthy Philippine coconut trees was ≈90 mg·g−1, and that of unhealthy Guam coconut trees was ≈40 mg·g−1. The starch concentration of the tissue within the CRB burrow locations on C. micronesica trees was 145 mg·g−1. Burrowing of C. micronesica was restricted to female CRB adults and was found throughout the full latitudinal gradient of Guam. Our findings indicate Guam’s unhealthy coconut trees are no longer nutrient-dense, and the female CRB population may have exhibited a phylogenetically distant host shift to the abundant C. micronesica plants for a starch-rich diet within the concepts of the ‘ecological fitting’ hypothesis. We add proximity to coconut tree habitats as a new threat to Guam’s endangered C. micronesica population.

            <div class="abstract">
                The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery and release of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s and 70s suppressed the pest such that no new invasions of uninfested islands by CRB were reported for over 30years after implementation of the biocontrol programme. Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007), which could not be controlled by OrNV. Subsequently, new invasions have been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); O’ahu, Hawai’i (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, CRB-G, which appears to be tolerant to OrNV. PCR analysis shows that OrNV is generally present at high incidence in established populations of CRB, but is generally absent from the invasive CRB-G populations. CRB-G from Guam was not susceptible to OrNV infection by oral delivery, but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis shows that CRB populations can be divided into a number of clades that coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis suggests that CRB-G originated in Asia, though the precise location remains to be discovered.

            <div class="abstract">
                Coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros; CRB) was discovered in 2015 in a small outbreak in Honiara, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. This was the first record of CRB from Solomon Islands and a response plan was prepared. An awareness programme was launched and where CRB sightings were confirmed, delimitation surveys were carried out. Following the launch of the awareness programme, later in 2015, CRB was also reported from the Shortland Islands in the Western Province. Other islands were surveyed from 2015 to 2020. If CRB presence was confirmed, beetles were collected and analysed for haplotype and presence of the classical biological control agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). A distribution map and timeline of invasion were developed. The initial populations belonged to two distinct haplotypes: CRB-G (clade IA) in Honiara and CRB-S (clade II) in Shortland Islands. Despite control measures, by 2020 CRB-G had spread to islands in eight provinces and CRB-S had spread to islands in seven provinces. CRB-S and CRB-G co-occur in Guadalcanal and Malaita provinces. In 2019, OrNV was detected from field collected CRB from Guadalcanal and has since spread to Malaita Island. In both cases the virus was detected where CRB-G and CRB-S co-occur. Other outbreak areas in Solomon Islands remain OrNV-free. The two haplotypes appear to have spread following patterns of air and sea movement between the point of origin (CRB-G from Honiara and CRB-S from the Shortland Islands) to other islands/provinces.

                An assay was developed for quantitation of the antigenic relationship between viruses, by modification of the indirect ELISA. The principle of this method is to estimate the epitopes not shared between the related viruses, after titration of the antibodies specific to the common epitopes as in a blocking ELISA. In practice, varying concentrations of purified virus are preincubated with a fixed dilution of heterologous or homologous antiserum and the unbound antibodies present in the mixture are back titrated with virus particles bound to microtitre plates. The antigenic relationship is described in terms of differentiation index (DI) and total antigenic reactivity (TAR). This method has been used to quantitate cross-reactivity between two geographically different isolates of Oryctes baculovirus.

                Oryctes baculovirus is a viral biocide exploited for the control of the insect pest Oryctes rhinoceros. We have recently established a physical map of the genome of the Indian isolate of Oryctes baculovirus (OBV-KI). Here we examine the genomic relatedness between OBV-KI and OBV-PV505, the type isolate (originally from the Philippines), by DNA reassociation kinetics and by the use of restriction endonucleases. On the basis of differences in restriction-enzyme profiles between the two genomes, and previously reported differences in protein profiles and antigenic makeup, we propose the taxonomic status of a variant of Oryctes baculovirus for the Indian isolate.

                Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10% and 38%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.

            <div class="abstract">
                Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected on Guam during 2007. Following a failed eradication program, we attempted to establish effective microbial control using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) imported from AgResearch New Zealand and green muscardine fungus (GMF), Metarhizium majus, imported from the Philippine Coconut Authority. OrNV was initially released by autodissemination but did not result in population suppression. Molecular analyses indicated that the Guam population is genetically distinct from other populations which had invaded Pacific Islands and laboratory bioassays indicated that this genotype is resistant to infection by OrNV isolates commonly used and released in the Pacific region. This novel biotype has been named CRB Biotype G (CRB-G) and it is spreading throughout the Pacific. GMF was released by autodissemination and incorporation of spores into CRB breeding sites. An extensive post- release survey indicated that field mortality from GMF was between 10% and 38%. Population suppression by GMF coupled with breeding site sanitation and other integrated pest management tactics did not prevent an uncontrolled island-wide CRB outbreak triggered by Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Adults emerging from abundant CRB breeding sites generated by this typhoon were numerous enough to kill large numbers of mature coconuts, initiating a positive feedback cycle whereby adults emerging from dead palms kill even more palms. History indicates that the most feasible way to stop the current outbreak on Guam is to find and release an OrNV isolate which is pathogenic for CRB-G. We are currently locating populations of CRB-G biotype within its native range and looking for OrNV isolates from these populations which can be used for effective microbial control.

                We measured containment rates for four types of netting. Only one type of fish net (14 mesh 0.25 mm nylon monofilament) , with a containment rate of 67% (an escape rate of 33%), proved useful as a barrier for adult CRB. This fish net is more than a physical barrier because beetles become permanently entangled. Most of the beetles escaping from the fish net were small. A higher mesh (smaller hole size) may reduce the high escape rate for smaller beetles.

            <div class="abstract">
                Optimization of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the rapid detection of Oryctes rhinoceros virus (OrV) was studied. The virus DNA was extracted from the gut tissues by a robust method. Using a pair of specific primers, Primer 15a and 15b, infection was confirmed when the PCR product produced a single 945 bp DNA band.  The optimized concentrations of the PCR components were at 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM 10X PCR buffer, 0.2 mM Primer 15a and 15b, 0.5 U Taq-DNA polymerase and 0.4 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA).  All tested virus DNA concentrations at 0.085, 0.170 and 0.255 μg μl-1 were suitable for virus detection.  Addition of BSA (20 mg ml-1) at 0.4 mg in the reaction increased the PCR sensitivity. The method is capable of detecting OrV infection from DNA diluted one million times or equivalent to a virus DNA concentration as low as 2.23 pg μl-1. The PCR detected 83.2% adult beetles from pheromone traps as being infected by OrV, 13.6% higher (P<0.05) than the results based on observations on the gut morphological appearance (69.6%). A typical OrV infection symptom is a swollen gut filled with milky fluid.  Of the 839 guts with this symptom, 97.6% were diagnosed to be infected which was not significantly different (P>0.05) compared to the method based on gut morphological appearance. The PCR was also capable in detecting virus at an early infection stage and in dead adults with decayed tissues. Of the 307 adults that appeared to be healthy, 36.1% of them were found to be infected.  As much as 61.6% of dead adults with decayed tissues (N = 428) were diagnosed to be infected by the OrV.  The method can be used in further research studies relating to OrV for the management of the rhinoceros beetle.

            <div class="abstract">
                The genus Metarhizium (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) is mostly composed of entomopathogenic fungal species. Many of these species are anamorphic and difficult to distinguish morphologically. Furthermore, most isolates of this genus have a broad host range, making classification based on host-insect species uncertain. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequence information distinguishes these species well and revises the taxonomy of Metarhizium. However, in the revisions, the major groups within the genus, such as M. anisopliae complex, were classified regardless of their phenotypic differentiation. Therefore, the characteristics of the individual species remain unclear. To explore the species-specific characteristics of Metarhizium spp., the author performed a phylogenetic analysis and characterization of Metarhizium spp. in Japan. The results showed that strains of the M. brunneum and M. pemphigi clades exhibited cold-active growth characteristics and preferred forested environments over M. pingshaense. In the M. majus clade, a specialist of scarab beetles, isolates from different Scarabaeidae species, including the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes spp.) and flower chafer beetle (Protaetia orientalis), formed separate subclades and showed strong virulence against their original hosts. This review describes the current state of understanding of the taxonomy and species-specific characteristics of the genus Metarhizium, and includes the author’s own previous study.

                The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L.), (CRB) is a major pest of coconut and oil palms that causes significant damage in the Asia/Pacific region. Traditional methods for surveillance and detection of CRB involve in-person inspections, but these are expensive to carry out and were made impossible by travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, a method to remotely detect possible CRB incursions and assess damage levels using publicly available images is described. The method involves searching for pictures of palms and identifying those with the distinctive V-shaped cuts in fronds characteristic of CRB feeding. The method was validated by examining palm images from known outbreak areas and those free from the pest. We found evidence of CRB damage in the previously unreported site of Dili, Timor Leste and possible evidence of CRB in the Solomon Islands even before it was first reported in 2015. Potential limitations and broader applications of this approach are also discussed.

                The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros, CRB), a native to South-east Asia, is a major pest of coconut and oil palms in the Pacific. Beetles produce an aggregation pheromone identified as ethyl 4-methyloctanoate (E4-MO). Beetles use this pheromone to locate suitable feeding sites in palms and breeding materials. E4-MO has been used for more than 30 years for monitoring and trapping of CRB but recent range expansion by the pest requires re-evaluation of strategies for its use. In this review, we present a brief history of CRB attractants and the discovery of E4-MO. We also describe pheromone-based strategies used to manage CRB, including pest detection, monitoring, and mass trapping. We identify issues and areas for improvement in pheromone-based strategies against CRB and suggest directions for future research to optimize the management of this invasive pest.

            <div class="abstract">
                The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB: Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus) is one of the most damaging pests to coconut and oil palms in Asia and the Pacific Islands. Adults bore into the crown and damage developing fronds, which affects tree development and yield. The insect is native to South and Southeast Asia and was inadvertently introduced into the Pacific in 1909. It has since spread to several Pacific island nations and territories , causing significant economic impact on these important coconut and palm-growing regions. In the 1950s and 1960s, an international biological control effort was initiated to search for and release natural enemy species. Release of the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus Huger (OrNV) and the species complex of Metarhizium Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) was successful in controlling CRB in its invaded range. Recently a new biotype of the beetle, known as CRB-G, has spread into the Pacific Islands causing unprecedented levels of damage due to the failure of previously successful biological control agents (BCAs) to suppress this biotype. The re-emergence of CRB as a serious pest warrants a rigorous re-evaluation of potential BCAs and a new search for effective natural enemies if necessary. In this article, we review literature on CRB to 1) analyze past introductions of BCAs and their effectiveness; 2) identify potentially important natural enemies and their geographical origins; and 3) assess possible approaches for utilization of BCAs against the new wave of CRB invasion. Research gaps and directions deserving future attention are highlighted and a strategy for renovation of biological controls for CRB suggested.

            <div class="abstract">
                It is now more than 100 years since the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB: Oryctes rhinoceros L.) was first detected in the Pacific Island state of Samoa. The exotic pest from Asia became the principal pest of coconut palms in Samoa and, from this first point of invasion, spread to several surrounding countries in the South-West Pacific Ocean. An intensive control operation was initiated, but the beetle could not be eliminated. Various pest management strategies were attempted but had limited success until the introduction of a biological control agent (BCA), Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The biocontrol release was very successful and became the prime example of “classical biological control” of an insect pest by a virus. Changing economic and social conditions in Samoa and other islands of the Pacific require a re-evaluation of the threat of CRB to coconut production to suggest how the IPM system may be modified to meet future needs. Therefore, it is timely to review the history of CRB in Samoa and summarize experiences in development of an integrated pest management (IPM) system limiting the impact of the pest. We also present results from a recent study conducted in 2020 on the island of Upolu to define the current status of the CRB population and its BCA, OrNV. The lessons from Samoa, with its long history of containment and management of CRB, are applicable to more recent invasion sites. Recommendations are provided to modify the IPM programme to enhance the sustainable control of CRB and support the ongoing coconut replantation program promoted by the Samoan government.

                The DSIR-HA-1179 coleopteran cell line is a susceptible and permissive host to the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), which has been used as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros); a pest of palms in the Asia-Pacific region. However, little is known about growth and metabolism of this cell line, knowledge of which is necessary to develop an in vitro large-scale OrNV production process. The strong anchorage-dependent characteristics of the cell line, its particular fragility and its tendency to form dense clumps when manipulated, are the most likely reasons that have precluded further development of the cell line. In order to characterize DSIR-HA-1179 cells, there was first a need for a reliable technique to count the cells. A homogenous cell suspension suitable for enumeration could be produced by treatment with TrypLE Express™ with optimum mean time for cell release calculated as 30 min. The cell line was adapted to grow in four serum-supplemented culture media namely TC-100, IPL-41, Sf-900 II and Sf-900 III and cell growth, glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production were assessed from static-batch cultures. The maximum viable cell density was reached in Sf-900 II (17.9 × 10(5) cells/ml), with the maximum specific growth rate observed in this culture medium as well (0.0074 h(-1)). Higher production of OrNV was observed in IPL-41 and TC-100 (4.1 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) than in cultures infected in Sf-900 III (2.0 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) and Sf-900 II (1.4 × 10(7) TCID50/ml). At the end of the growth period, glucose was completely consumed in cultures grown in TC-100, while remained in excess in the other three culture media. The cell line produced lactate and ammonia to very low levels in the TC-100 culture medium which is a promising aspect for its cultivation at large-scale.

            <div class="abstract">
                The powder formulation of Metarhizium anisopliae was applied by spraying method onto the rotting heaps of oil palm residues under the leguminous cover crops. The M. anisopliae infected all stages of Oryctes rhinoceros. At eight months after treatment (MAT), the application of product at rates of T1, 0.2 g (2.2 x 10 7 spores) and T2, 0.4 g (4.4 x 10 7 spores) m -2 heap was significantly reduced (P<0.05) the L2 and L3 larvae, pre-pupae and pupae. Reduction of these four stages has reduced the overall O. rhinoceros population in T1 to 30.8 individual per sampling plot (ISP) and T2 to 41.0 ISP, significant lower (P<0.05) as compared to population in the control (132.1 ISP). The growing of cover crops delayed the impact time of the fungus, but it provided protection to the fungus from the detrimental factors, giving favourable conditions to the spores to grow and initiate infection. Therefore, at eight MAT, as the population was significantly reduced, the infection levels were increased to 33.3% in T1 and 30.4% in T2, both were significantly higher (P<0.05) as compared to control (12.9%). Then it was further increased to 52.0% (control), 67.8% (T1) and 72.9% (T2) at 12 MAT. The use of the product at both rates did not affect the non-target insects. The oil palm pollinating weevil, Elaeidobius kamerunicus was not affected as they was no difference in the population density in the treated and control plots. The population density of the stag beetle, Aegus chelifer in both treated plots was always not significant (P>0.05) with the control at all times of data recording. Although infection can occur on larvae and adults, but the percentage was low, ranging from 0% -0.6% at five MAT and 1.7% and 2.5% at eight MAT.

                The rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, has emerged as a serious pest of oil palm since the prohibition of burning as a method for maintaining estate hygiene in the 1990s. The abundance of beetles is surprising given that the Malay peninsula was the site of first discovery of the Oryctes virus, which has been used to effect good as a biological control agent in other regions. A survey of adult beetles was carried out throughout Malaysia using pheromone traps. Captured beetles were examined for presence of virus using both visual/microscopic examination and PCR detection methods. The survey indicated that Oryctes virus was common in Malaysia among the adult beetles. Viral DNA analysis was carried out after restriction with HindIII enzyme and indicated at least three distinct viral genotypes. Bioassays were used to compare the viral strains and demonstrate that one strain (type B) is the most virulent against both larvae and adults of the beetle. Virus type B has been cultured and released into healthy populations where another strain (type A) forms the natural background. Capture and examination of beetles from the release site and surrounding area has shown that the spread and persistence of the applied virus strain is accompanied by a reduction in palm frond damage.

            <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
            <div class="abstract">
                The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) is a severe pest of coconut and other palms that has invaded the South Pacific in the last decade. The beetle can cause great economic losses, not only to agriculture but also due to indirect impacts on tropical aesthetics and tourism. In the last decade, new invasive populations of the beetle have been detected on Guam and Oahu, Hawaii. Despite the beetle’s extensive invasion history and economic impacts, little is known about its invasion dynamics. We used 1,480 base pairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial and 814 base pairs of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase nuclear DNA to conduct a population genetics analysis on eight beetle populations from Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China in the beetle’s native range and Palau, American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii in the beetle’s invasive range, in an attempt to resolve invasion pathways. Genetic diversity was insufficient to generate strong evidence for O. rhinoceros movement patterns. Mitochondrial DNA provided a clear but poorly supported population structure. Although nuclear DNA proved to be more diverse, population structure lacked clear signal. This lack of diversity is congruent with a rapid, recent invasion. There appears to be no genetic exchange between populations once they establish, implying that they are rare, human-mediated dispersal events.

                <div data-schema-version="8"><p>2024-09-12_Rodrigez_transcript.txt</p> <p>you so for our uh our final talk before we get to the Q&amp;A I want to give a welcome to Dr Roberto Rodriguez as well as Timo Sullivan um Roberto is assistant professor of aeronautical Sciences at the University of Hawaii at Hilo um Tim O Sullivan is with Aloha AA drones um and the title of this talk is drone based aerial application for crb and I'll turn it over to you Roberto to share your screen whenever you're ready all right thank you very much ell just give me a moment to share that screen all right and so we've actually have kind of two presentations that are back toback so I'm going to try and get through this one a little faster so that I can give my colleague a little more time um so in this one it's basically kind of the initial experiments to develop an aerial treatment method for crb using uh commercial offthe shelf unmaned aircraft systems so had a couple talks yesterday regarding kind of imagery and how to process that in order for detection so this is more on the treatment side so it's kind of what do you get on the basic sample and then what modifications are necessary to make it so they can perform this type of spot spray treatment and so there are two main things that had to be changed in order to do this one is to reorient the cameras since they are designed to face forward and back and not really look down which is what you need to look at and then also change the nozzle configuration so it's something that is compatible with this type of application and so specifically we need to meet the label requirements where for a medium or coar droplet and then having that uh swath with be less than the canopy of a or less than the Crown size of our coconut trees so kind of in the Box the T10 which we have several of those kind of throughout Hawaii where different organizations is there are four primary nozzle bodies each mounted underneath the rotor and they originally come with uh nozzle tips that'll produce a very fine spray which would be outside of our label specifications so the first thing was to swap that over for a nozzle tip which would produce those corser droplet sizes and then the other was moving that camera and so we had to validate that the droplet size that we were getting out of this was correct and our swwa was within uh specifications to treat the canopies so in this plot you can see one of the passes that we did we were getting these Ultra coarse and extremely coarse droplet sizes and the majority of the spray was basically within four feet to 5 feet so that was sufficient for the kind of application we were wanting to do and a little bit more information on the droplet sizes and so as far as the camera mounting so kind of our first prototype which was just to really get something out there in order to do these treatments was a small 3D print in order to turn the rear facing camera and point it straight down and so this did work and Timo will go through some of the uh results of those applications but it wasn't quite the ideal so it was producing these rather large um again about a 4 foot swath width so it would cover a large area but it also had a dead spot underneath directly underneath the aircraft since all those nozzles are at the four rotors and then with that rear-facing camera it was forcing the left and right fields to be swapped so the pilot would basically be trying to move in One Direction and the camera would be in the opposite direction so the idea was basically switch to using the front camera and try and mount a single nozzle body rather than using the ones that already exist on the airf frame and to do this required kind of retrofitting the aircraft and cutting a lot of the tubing in order to reroute that to that single nozzle body and so these are some of the specifications for those parts if you are interested in kind of doing this modification to an aircraft that you have and we can provide these uh to anyone who's interested in those and the other two parts are two 3D printed Parts one being to mount the camera from the front facing portion as well as to mount the nozzle body to the aircraft frame itself and so kind of the process is first removing one of the uh styrofoam pieces that is directly in front of the nozzle pumps which is right next to the front camera so that you can access the wiring and then remove that camera and disconnect it to Mount the new piece and so it'll actually be mounted kind of directly between the two primary pumps and then at this point you are avoiding the warranty that you have from the factory but you're having to cut some of the tubing introduce these T brackets which will allow you to still make use of the original nozzle sets if you need them but also reroute tubing in order to um route them to that primary nozzle you're now mounting at the base and then as you do that you'll also have to trim some of the tubing in order to make that work so that requires actually removing the foam guards that are around the rotors themselves in order to access where that tubing meets the actual nozzle body and then trimming that down so that you can then re secure those nozzles back and then this is the mounting so it's actually directly underneath one of the primary pumps using some existing holes already in the frame so you're not having to redrill anything and then this is the nozzle body where it's having the two ends coming from rerouted from those two nozzles that are at the sides of the air C mounting to that single nozzle directly underneath and then this is what that'll look like so again you got a front-facing camera and you're able to see kind of this one solid stream striking down at the actual uh pal and so the benefit of this one is that it's putting all of your product right at the mar stem rather than kind of scattering it all along the frond which is really putting products in places that it doesn't need to be you really want to focus that in directly on that um primary miror stem and so this particular project is a partnership from several over there organizations so thanks to those uh partners and other funding agencies and now I will hand things over to Tim O solivan thanks I appreciate all that let me share my screen here one moment please all right thanks for that one yes as Roberto mentioned I'm Timo Sullivan and I'm here to present on a really exciting model for management I think we discovered earlier this year um this was basically a rapid response to an early detection of a crb and a golf course on Kei Maui um in partnership with MK so in November 2023 a single dead Palm trunk yielded 17 crb larvae was discovered um 97 suspect Palms identified within the immediate buffer area um by by the crb response team so this is a very scary thing right this was the the first crb discovered on Maui um a decision was made by the HD USDA and MK uh to treat those 97 suspect Palms within a certain buffer area via drone application to use so as a Berto mentioned we use a DJI aggress T10 which is modified um thanks to the hard work work and groundwork Via Daniel do Jenkins and Dr Rodriguez um along this was a FAA 13 exemption which is certificate from the FAA which allows us to apply commercial product from the air and basically with this drone tool set and this exemption we are able to treat crb populations from aircraft AKA drone the prescription for this area on the right you can see the N actually the 100 Palms that R treated via drone application um again this was a golf course so we basically loaded this drone up into a golf cart and drove from tree to tree along the sidewalks and treated clusters of trees um as we could the solution you can see on the left but basically this is a either a half gallon or full gallon drench of demon Max Perry which um theoretically can provide protection from crb for months so I would argue that this drone system was an Ideal tool for early detection rapid response um to a nent population of crb we were able to treat over 100 actually palm trees exactly across the course of four working days um however on average we were able to treat 12 Palms per hour that's a palm every five minutes if you exclude the actual action of moving from tree to tree on the ground um a drone is ideal for this kind of work I would argue because the mobility allows you to treat trees that you couldn't access via helicopter sorry via helicopter uh crane ladder that kind of thing especially when they're oddly shaped you can see this coconut tree here on the left is kind of in the back and bunch of kave so it' be quite hard to get up there via human um or crane truck so we argue drones are ideal for that um more than anything it is a huge safety tool right because for a human technician to climb that tree and apply set pesticide they themselves are being exposed to the pesticide as well as risking their life by going up far above the ground um furthermore drone drench asert as Dr Rodriguez pointed out can be very very surgically applied to a tree um mitigating for wind factors and such um and more so given that these uh systems are equipped with high-end data collection software we feel quite act we feel quite safe that the amount of pesticide applied to the tree was a correct amount and after this action it's been some fantastic news to this date we have not seen any other crb uh on Mau since initial detection so in a lot of ways we would argue this uh technique was a success in at least controlling um for crb in the immediate buffer zone of the initial detector population so if you excuse me for a second I'd like to offer my own company so we are lohana drones we are a part 107 137 certified company so that allows us to apply AAL product from uh pesticide or ccial product from the air we also hold air appc license from the HG together amongst the team we have 30 years of combined experience using drones for conservation efforts and we are currently the only drone company in Hawaii I'm aware of has direct experience treating CRV um here is our my new family member it's a DJI agis T20 as opposed to T10 so that's twice the capacity of the initial T10 we've modified the system as Dr Rodriguez has pointed out for a number of different spot treatments we can fly for a long time and we get these advanced Safety operations um and finally most importantly we are conservation based agency and our pricing really really shows that we're here a save Hawaii not to make a living as my members hate to say so we would be very very interested in helping protect uh Hawaii from crb and frankly the cross specific for years to come here again this model of rapid response to ear detection of C population via drone application I think is a fantastic model that we should consider and think about as time goes on given both the efficacy efficiency safety and the cost reasons so if you have any interest in in working with us you can see my contact information here again I really appreciate you allow me to uh solicit some business during a fantastic Symposium with a lot of smart people doing a lot of smart things at that point I'm say thank you my co-authors and um thank you all for hosting this amazing Symposium oh we do have time for a couple questions thank you so much so feel free to for both of you to leave your cameras on if if you have time so um first one I'm seeing in the zoom chat so the initial detection was 97 trees of the golf course and those were confirmed to have crb um I'm sorry if I was confusing there so a single tree was found that contain 17 crb larvae and based off in some GIS work we basically created a buffer around that initial uh detection tree and so those 97 tree 97 trees that were treated were suspect trees even that they showed signs of damage or more so they were in the immediate um immigration area of a crb specimen so only one tree showed crb but treated 97 proactive to protect them and hopefully um you know control their War crb individuals present within those trees great thank you um there's another uh question here is emergency drone treatment being conducted on Kawaii and then I'll I'll add to that else any else other places that you're working yes well I think Dan Jenkins if he's on might want to jump in here or Roberto feel free to hop in I know that Dan Jenkins cut his teeth uh his initial drone work on kaai and aahu um however I'm currently not familiar with any going on right now in kwaii if someone else in the in the room is I'd be very curious to hear and if not we'd be very interested in helping and uh we've got another question um maybe we can do one or two more so um please keep the questions coming um so any indication of the cost of using drones plus pesticide per tree in Hawaii that's a fantastic question gosh so we are currently guess I'm slicing some business here we are currently charging $175 per hour to spray via our drone platform um as I said we average about 12 Trees per hour so you can break that down there but I would argue maybe $20 per tree if not less thanks for that and there's a comment um this is great news possibly an eradication only the second crb ever as far as I know yay agreed so keep our keep our fingers crossed we definitely need to have more than one one rication success story in the Pacific so hopefully this is a a pathway to get there uh I'm just going to check the uh the crb live YouTube to see if there are any other questions there and I am not seeing any at the moment so thank you so much thank you hello everyone all right well we're the the </p> </div>

                Palms are important crops in the tropics. The coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) produces nuts which is used directly for food or the contained copra may be crushed to yield coconut oil. The Rhinoceros beetles (Scarabaeidae, Dynastinae) are important pests of palms. Attacks by adults may reduce yield, kill both seedlings and old palms and discourage replanting. Now a days Oryctes rhinoceros is an important pest attacking young oil palms in Asia and it cause signicant damage on coconut oil palm bringing severe reduction in nut production. The morphological and biological characteristic of Oryctes rhinoceros was done in the captive rearing and observed systematically. The morphological and developmental process of Oryctes rhinoceros fed with the mixture of cow dung and saw dust under the laboratory conditions 28 ±1ºC were recorded. The body weight and length at various developmental stages were measured. It undergo complete metamorphosis and has four developmental stages (Egg, Grub, Pupa and adult) in the whole life period.

                This research was carried out to determine the effective inoculation method and optimum concentration of local Oryctes virus (OrV) for successful infection of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) adults in laboratory which released to the field to spread the viral disease among healthy larvae and beetles. Percentage of infected beetles were significantly different (P<0.001) among the two methods of inoculation and untreated control. After 21 days of inoculation, oral introduction method, swim method and control recorded 88.8%, 44.4% and 11.1% of OrV infection respectively indicating the most effective inoculation method as oral introduction. Cumulative percentage mortality of O. rhinoceros adults with 101 ppm,102 ppm, 103 ppm, 104 ppm and 105 ppm concentrations were recorded as 7.3%, 25.1%, 33.3%, 81.4% and 100% respectively. LC50 was 102.7ppm and LT50 for 104 ppm and 105 ppm concentrations were 23 days and 12 days respectively. Best concentration to oral inoculation of O. rhinoceros with OrV for field release was selected as 104 ppm.

            <div class="abstract">
                Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros L., is a serious pest of coconut and oil palms throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific. CRB was found on Guam in 2007 and, despite suppression efforts, has subsequently spread across the island. The CRB population on Guam is genetically different from other populations in Asia and the Pacific, and is considered a new invasive biotype (termed CRB-G). CRB-G is apparently resistant to Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, the preferred biocontrol agent for this pest. CRB populations are typically controlled with a combination of biocontrol, pheromone traps, and breeding site removal. A field trial was performed at six locations on Guam to test potential improvements to standard CRB pheromone trapping with oryctalure (ethyl 4-methyloctanoate). Two modifications were tested, 1) addition of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs), and 2) reduction of pheromone release rate. Addition of UV LED light sources to pheromone traps significantly increased trap catch by 2.85 times. Reduction in oryctalure release rate by up to an order of magnitude did not significantly change CRB capture rate. Further, when linear regression analyses of CRB trap capture rate as a function of pheromone release rate were conducted for traps with and without UV LEDs separately, only a very weak relationship between trap capture and oryctalure release rate was observed and only when a UV LED was present. Results suggest that addition of UV LED light sources to pheromone traps could improve detection trapping of CRB and that reduction of pheromone release rate could extend service life of lures without changing capture rate.

                Juvenile palms in the age group of one to six years are prone to damage in the crown by rhinoceros beetle. Damage by the beetle results in ‘V’ shaped cuts in the leaf lamina and repeated attacks by the pest results in reduced leaf area for photosynthesis. Integrated pest management modules were developed for the management of coconut rhinoceros beetles and were validated under field conditions. Validation studies undertaken in three locations revealed that IPM practices including setting up of Rhinolure (PCI®) pheromone traps @ one per ha, field release of Oryctes rhinoceros virus suspension treated adults @ 15 per ha, placement of naphthalene balls @ 10 to 12 g per palm in the innermost leaf axil once in 45 days and application of green muscardine fungi, Metarhizium anisopliae to the manure pits during rainy seasons resulted in reduction in leaf and spindle damage to less than 10 per cent in all the locations tested. Site occupancy studies revealed the presence of virus infected O. rhinoceros and green muscardine fungus infected grubs in the manure pits adjacent to the experimental plots.

                Abstract                            Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB),               Oryctes rhinoceros               , is a pest of palm trees in the Pacific. Recently, a remarkable degree of palm damage reported in Guam, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands has been associated with a particular haplotype (clade I), known as “CRB-G”. In the Palau Archipelago, both CRB-G and another haplotype (clade IV) belonging to the CRB-S cluster coexist in the field. In this study, more than 75% of pheromone trap-captured adults of both haplotypes were Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV)-positive by PCR. No significant difference in OrNV prevalence between the haplotypes was detected. In PCR-positive CRB-G tissue specimens from Palau, viral particles were observed by electron microscopy. Hemocoel injection of CRB larvae with crude virus homogenates from these tissues resulted in viral infection and mortality. OrNV isolated from Palauan-sourced CRB was designated as OrNV-Palau1. Both OrNV-Palau1 and OrNV-X2B, a CRB biological control isolate released in the Pacific, were propagated using the FRI-AnCu-35 cell line for production of inoculum. However, the OrNV-Palau1 isolate exhibited lower viral production levels and longer larval survival times compared to OrNV-X2B in               O. rhinoceros               larvae. Full genome sequences of the OrNV-Palau1 and -X2B isolates were determined and found to be closely related to each other. Altogether these results suggest CRB adults in Palau are infected with a less virulent virus, which may affect the nature and extent of OrNV-induced pathology in Palauan populations of CRB.

about a bit more of the CRV genetics um and the mitochondrial uh genome analysis and the Hypes in crb so this is Dr Tech T from uh CSO from Australia Tech if you could go ahead and turn on your camera and share your screen and take it away thank you all right we see your edit screen in PowerPoint so if you just go to your presentation or pres presentation mode can you hear me yes we can hear you okay uh thank you for for the invitation to present some of the work that uh that my team and and colleagues have been working on with we started this work with a fairly small funding from the Austrian government Department of Foreign Affairs and trade so I like to take this opportunity to thank uh the funding support from the Austrian government so today I'm going to talk about uh looking at the whole problem from someone who had never worked on coconut run or Speedos before but with f extensive uh experience uh working on various molecular uh tools and genomic population genomics on invasive species okay so so we all know about the uh fairly influential paper by New Zealand uh colleagues uh Sean and and Trevor and and various other people using the mitochondrial dna1 which is a barcoding gene region 676 base pair approximately that identify a unique signature present in Guam and this signature was subsequently also detected in various islands and the associated studies where the uh virus was unable to be established in Guan population and this was somehow uh link to uh by other studies to the presence of the similar signature across Pacific Islands and therefore some somehow concluded that the other Island populations with the Guam signature are also resistance and over the uh times since uh early 2000 to currently this signature has been detected in many different populations across both invasive and introduction ranges there have been uh a few other population genomics studies looking at whole genome signatures uh genome white uh signatures uh for example by the Hawaii Hawaii University Group by Jon Jonathan and colleagues where again the Guam hype or the G hype have been identified uh again based on the mitochondrial DNA co1 Gene and this was detected in for example in Hawaii in Guam in palao and also in Taiwan suggesting that again potentially this signature is being uh detected across everywhere however if we actually look at the same paper uh looking at the nuclear DNA signature the gu population actually has not been detected anywhere else across all the other uh sample populations so this is a bit of a uh conundrum because from the same individuals and depending on the type of Market that one is using it somehow gave different uh information and conclusion so in this study if we were to go with the nuclear genome Guam actually hasn't really gone anywhere at all likewise another study from Caven and colleagues from Australia they look at the population genomic studies using hogum sequencing approach again there were many different uh conclusions reached for example the presence of uh the the G hype on Solomon Islands which was supposed to be resistant to the virus however when they look at the virus genome they are actually detected in some of the G individuals and the studies actually had some fundamental issues for example there is a uh assumption that uh because there have been this unique gu mitochondrial DNA hypotype being detected and Report therefore one can apply that previous studies and just assume that that is the same signature being uh and and can be detected across the other uh Pacific island nations uh in such a studies it would really be more appropriate to also include the original populations from Guam as well which wasn't included so you can see that uh this uh study by uh atar uh therefore suggested that the Guam s is also detected in Solomon Islands and new calonia and so forth so based on all this uh very extensive Studies by many different groups there have been various uh IPM options being developed but one thing that is being proposed uh based on the knowledge that we had before is that one needs to determine the biotype and test for the virus and that it would be important to match the virus strain to the CB B type so this really requires time and funding which unfortunately as we know the virus are that the beetle uh and the lobi uh are there 24/7 the beetle will attack the tree 247 and funding is difficult to come by so uh having this approach while it may be valid uh requires a lot of uh effort and and the time that we didn't really have furthermore we know that currently there is no virus uh that is uh identified to be uh able to to uh be effective control for the CBG so there is a need to for example uh look for alternative bical control agent such as met resum uh so what is it that is so difficult to understand or or make it clear why we are experiencing such conflicting findings with respect to whether uh the type of markers we're using the co1 versus a nuclear or whether there should be a specific strain of virus that we should be looking at to Target specific population so I'm going to take it back to the original concept about the mitochondrial D genome this inherited from mother uh has about 37 genes some are coding and some are non-coding genes it is inherit as a single genome so from mother to uh to her children and it's always passing on from the female line so the assumption is that if the co1 is identical then the other genome region must also be identical and if we're looking at here on the top right hand corner this is the mitochondrial D gen of about 20,000 base pair 21,000 base pair and we're only using about 670 base pair that is we're only using 3% of the mitr DNA genome to try to track a really really significant agricultureal pest so here these are some uh real data so this is a Guam uh individual which has this specific type of uh co1 signature and if you look at just a the 670 base pair region you would conclude that Philippines Rota Hawaii Taiwan uh PNG Marshal islands and Solomon Islands or have a g half type whereas Fiji and Sam they have something different likewise for plow there's also something different but if we extend it across to the whole mitoch D genome we can see that in fact this is not the case because we're essentially looking at very short region of the genome that limit our powers of detection and and differentiation so Guam is actually really really different has this two other unique uh uh base substitution that differentiated from everything else so if that's the case now not just looking at a 670 base per region but looking at the whole mitochondria D gen know Guam actually hasn't gone anyway so this is indeed what we did we look at the whole molate genome of Guam as well as uh other populations from Philippines Hawaii Solan Islands Marshal islands and and so forth and including substantial from native range such as uh Indonesia which is here and also Malaysia and we can see that Guam indeed really hasn't gone anywhere Guam just remain on Guam surprisingly we were able to detect another new populations from samples provided to us just in uh two years ago where Guan population actually had another offshoot and this likely represent a very recent introduction so this show that populations can be quite mixed and have very different uh Origins they're not just a single population and that in reality if Guam is a concern because it had not been able to have the virus established then gu hasn't spread anywhere then how do we actually reconcile the widespread reported severe damage and control failure uh when it's uh when the the countries are mistakenly informed that they have the the g b ti so that's something that we actually need to address and I think that that's probably something to do with the fact that it's uh ability to properly uh identify the population and we're giving the wrong advice so you've seen this from Mark's uh presentation earlier but if we were to reassess using the Home mitochondri D genome now can see that the paway is actually really really different so for example Sri Lanka has been suggested as the uh origin for samaa and Fiji and in fact that's the case we could link the population from some s and Fiji Direct directly to Sri Lanka we can also identify Malaysia to have been responsible for for example Solomon Islands and their link between Solomon Islands and papon guini and in fact Solomon Islands uh population was also link with Marshall Islands which was the most recent introduction Pala had both Philippines and Indonesia and Rota and Hawaii for example as as Taiwan had Philippines so a summary from that uh from from the presentation that just spoke about uh using PCA we can see that um the green boxes of green highlighted uh populations are native and the salmon color uh countries are introduced ranges and we can see that there are multiple populations uh such as Malaysia that's been detected elsewhere uh in different places Philippine and Taiwan appear to be uh responsible or very tightly linked with a lot of uh invasive ranges likewise Malaysia and even within China it's uh their internal movement within native ranges as well and we can see that these are actually the B security house fors so Philippines engine IIA and Malaysia appear to be uh the hotpots for a lot of the Pacific island nations uh CB populations and this is important because we have another really important uh past uh group the rink of forest uh Palm wvil they are in the same native range as the coconut rhosus Speedos and these are major has for for example uh coconut as well as palm oil and if coconut Ros bu can get to the Pacific using this uh weak bi security uh measures uh options so can these other invasive WS as well right uh that's what I think so if we are still really quite Keen to track the Guam population which is important because because we know that the Guam and uh the the Guam population has been uh reported as as resistant to the virus and as Mark also pointed out that you know other populations are known to be resistant population such as Philippines and indonesias and we have identified that these are the bi security hotspots then we really need a very effective marker to track the Guan po infation and we have actually working with uh New Zealand and Indonesia as well as um Philippines and palao and Guan we have developed an alternative set of markers which combines two genes to differentiate Guam away from the other populations whereas if you use a co1 you are unable to properly differentiate the Guan population from the rest so this is currently uh rev uh it has been revised and resubmitted so hopefully it'll be accepted soon so going forward going a bit forward in terms of what we understood with uh the genome signature now and and and and addressing the question about do we need to match the CRV bar type with a single or MV strain we we know that in the past studies for example by zenne and colleagues they have undertaken this type of experiment in the ma they've carry out experiments involving either mix or single isolates and they were able to demonstrate that at least the report that the most effective isolate was an isolate called x2b from the Philippines however uh even though they this is a claim but if you read the paper there actually no detail about how this x2b is uh reconfirmed as the isolate being the most effective also the in in some cases X in some cases x2b were introduced however unknown isolates will recover as far as there is a huge uh High mutation rates based on what we currently know from genome sequencing of the the the virus and so this can rapidly lead to mutation and so there are a lot of issues uh that may be associated with just introducing a single strain so um again I'm just going to re reiterate that for for the cases the Solon islands has been talk about the need to test the range of different uh virus strains to hopefully identify one that is effective again is a g so just bear in mind that as the whole genome or at least the whole mitochondrial D genome are evidence is suggesting that San Islands at least doesn't have the CBG and do we really need to go ahead and and do individual strain testing I think that uh that is up for debates but based on previous studies it would seem that if you introduce multiple isolates perhaps a most effective if isol spe x2b or something else may emerge anyway and that's necessary because if we look at the published virus genome studies uh there's been two very very good study very timely studies that have been published one by New Zealand and one by Australia and if we look at one of the x2b isolate that's been published The genome signature is is really really difficult to to interpret and we can't really conf firm with all these different uh single nucleotype polymorphism dotted across the genome to really use that specific polymorphism to say we have a specific isolates furthermore there are many genes over 130 genes potentially in the virus genome and not all genes functionalities are known we also do not know that in an infected crb at least in the native range whether this is actually by a single isolate or is it by many different isolates and what about in CV populations where there are multiple Origins so they're multiple biotypes if you like or biotypes doesn't really mean anything just where there is higher genetic diversity in the introduced population so which isolate do you actually need to use to cover all these different genetic uh variability within the host population so these are questions that I think we may be facing if we are trying to choose to identify a specific isolates of the virus to use and finally I just want to quickly show in the second last two slides that we actually look at the genome B genomic basis of the of the virus infection and we have Indonesian populations all across here where we have confirmation by visual uh dissection showing that these are infected individuals versus healthy individuals and you can see that the the the hom sequence reads are high over million reads most of them and in this case where this is representative of a natural population we don't just have one isolate we have many different isolates under natural conditions and we should be really pushing to repeat this type of uh approach uh or the condition for the introduced populations so in Indonesia if you look at the Indonesian populations overall they are the same isolate if you like but they're just different genetic variation across so not just one variation likewise for the others the others meaning uh representing Malaysia as well as the other uh Pacific Islands there are many different uh isolate cite uh the very high genetic variation so we shouldn't be just pushing for looking for one specific isolate to try to address the crbg and likewise we didn't actually know a lot about the genome basis so in some cases where the uh dissection indicated that the CB actually has really healthy guts we're able to detect a lot of virus uh sequences in there as well so these are issues that we are still currently working to to address it uh so my last slide uh look at the implications of on the uh IPM strategy that we're trying to develop for uh the CB based on what we currently know uh based on whole approach that is uh if we're trying to match a specific B type with a specific straint why we doing this now when in the in the past as far as under natural condition this is not the case so we need to really think carefully to see how we can repeat earlier successes uh uh that have been uh trial and and and shown in for example in Fiji and the mives so again the original Guam CV is not present across other Pacific Islands at least not during the time that we did the sampling uh two to three years ago so how is it that when CBG is misidentified it is then supposedly causing second coconut palm damage as well so that's something that we really need to think carefully and try to work out why is it that we come to the conclusion that once a country has been told that they have the CBG they also reporting that they this huge amount of damage is it because of specific IPM solution that is not properly developed or or sub optim developed so we really need to reevaluate current IPM approach as well as increase our understanding of the the Genome of the virus and the next talk by Ben Hoffman will talk about the important of improving pH phytosanitary practices but I was just want to uh highlight that this is really important and we need to work that together with the a genome approach to detect new introductions and maybe we can use that as a solution because if a virus is naturally introduced the new introduction populations then the virus is there for example this may be the case that might go forward for awaii for example if you have something that's difficult so if you can really detect the novel introductions but potentially you can actually get virus naturally coming in and you can identify the populations properly and utilize that uh that resource that is uh coming up from from a bad situation of introductions thank you so this work was again founded by the uh austrialian Department of Foreign Affairs and trade and we are not able to do all this work without all the international uh support uh and colleagues thank you great thank you so much tech oh sorry um uh great talk this was a lot of information on the genetics of the crb and also the O andv that's been detected in the crb genomes when they or specimens that have been samp uh sequenced um there were a number of questions and comments in the uh chat while you were speaking and we do have a few minutes if we could go ahead and address some of those and um one of the uh one of the first is from James grella this is Jim it he says it seems like we have to uh evaluate the use of the terms crbg crbs and crb PNG that supposedly designate susceptible versus non-susceptible crb populations um so there's no question here but how would you uh based on all of the genetics work that you've been um doing in the last couple of years how would you uh recommend or suggest that the different um biotypes or different genotypes start being uh referred to Yes uh thank you look well picked up by by the the person sorry I miss the name Jim Jim yep uh look I I truly believe that your spot on there uh we shouldn't be using uh the old names uh we should at least move away from referring a population and it's uh assume status uh resistance status to a specific protype uh we shouldn't be using the the temp type either so in terms of how do we address it I think similar to the white fly uh scenario you might be able to address it by the location where it came from but certainly you should not attach resistance status to any of the population unless they're properly tested I have no solution for naming it I'm not I haven't thought about how to name it what I'm thinking about is how to actually resolve the uh the many different conflicting results coming out from the use of partial genome or partial Gene as markers uh and the and the different proposal of uh IPM Solutions I'm just trying to think in a more holistic uh approach so uh yeah I don't have an answer for for that now okay um yeah so just some comments in the chat about what excellent insights and great presentation and the way a very good job on explaining all this complex information uh there was another question from Jane beachy um and this may uh you may be able to address this or we may actually ask this again uh during this afternoon's open Q&amp;A panel uh but from Jane beachi she asks uh besides the difference in susceptibility to nudi virus are there other other differences between crb types such as habitat preference tolerance to cold heat preferences for relative humidity or reproductive success so I don't know if you'd be able to address that or if we move that to this afternoon's panel perhaps to the afternoon panel you I mean believe it or not I actually because I live in CRA Australia which is Inland and have in the altitude and it's cold I didn't actually come into contact with cocanut orpos Al together but yeah look I think it's very interesting and it's really really important question because under the current climate change scenario all this uh you know different habitats micro uh habitat microclimatic uh uh I guess environment and and all the other related ecological questions uh to to the actual H would be really really important but at the moment I probably can't answer that okay well we'll add that on for um possible inclusion in this afternoon's panel uh so we're at 10:18 um this morning uh sorry um so we are scheduled for a break right now so we have a five minute by break uh but in the meantime during the break we have a a short video that Aubrey Moore who presented yesterday he's offered to show during the break time so um if we can get that queued up is Aubrey on the line um to share his screen for the video uh the answer is yes and yes okay great so um we'll be meeting back here uh at 2:25 to continue on with the next session but in the meantime here's this </p> </div>

                A partial mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene haplotype variant of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) Oryctes rhinoceros classed as ‘CRB-G (clade I)’ has been the focus of much research since 2007 with reports of invasions into new Pacific Island locations (e.g., Guam, Hawaii, Solomons Islands). For numerous invasive species, inference of invasion biology via whole genome is superior to assessments via the partial mtCOI gene. Here, we explore CRB draft mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from historical and recent collections, with assessment focused on individuals associated within the CRB-G (clade I) classification. We found that all Guam CRB individuals possessed the same mitogenome across all 13 protein coding genes and differed from individuals collected elsewhere, including ‘non-Guam’ individuals designated as CRB-G (clade I) by partial mtCOI assessment. Two alternative ATP6 and COIII partial gene primer sets were developed to enable distinction between CRB (clade I) that invaded Guam and CRB-G (Clade I) individuals collected elsewhere. Phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated ATP6-COIII genes showed that only Guam CRB-G (clade I) individuals clustered together, and therefore Guam was not the source of the CRB that invaded the other locations in the Pacific assessed in this study. The use of the mtCOI and/or mtCOIII genes for initial molecular diagnosis of CRB remained crucial, and assessment of more native CRB populations will further advance our ability to identify the provenance of CRB invasions being reported within the Pacific and elsewhere

                Oryctes rhinoceros, coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), was first confirmed as present in Honiara, Solomon Islands in January 2015. Based on initial delimiting surveys it was determined that it had likely been there for at least two generations before it was detected and that consequently eradication was not an option. Soon after, scientists at AgResearch, New Zealand, confirmed it was the 'G' (Guam) strain of the species that is not susceptible to the nudivirus that controls another strain of CRB elsewhere in the South Pacific. An emergency response plan was developed but due to inadequate financing implementation has been inconsistent and weak, consequently it has spread and is now reported on parts of seven islands. More recently some funding has become available and a three-pronged management approach is being implemented: sanitation to reduce populations by destroying breeding sites (rotting palm logs, green manure, compost and chicken manure), restricting spread through internal quarantines on shipping and biological control by identifying effective entomopathogens for the long term. Work to identify strains of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) effective against CRB-G is reported elsewhere in this symposium. Some preliminary details of work to introduce the green muscardine fungus, Metarhyzium anisopleae, are reported here.

                The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) is one of the most destructive insect pests of coconut and oil palms in tropical Asia and the Pacific islands. Members of a new variant, known as CRB-G (clade I), have recently spread into the Pacific islands, causing significant damage. Biopesticides containing Metarhizium spp. are the strongest candidates for inundative biological control against the emerging CRB threat. Selection of the most virulent and robust isolate may determine the impact of this control option on the pest. In this work, CRB specimens with natural fungal infection were collected in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon Islands (SI). Putative entomopathogenic fungi were isolated and identified. These new isolates and some previously obtained from other Pacific countries were molecularly identified, characterized, and tested for virulence against CRB larval populations in PNG and SI in laboratory bioassays. Of the new isolates collected, four obtained from SI were identified as Metarhizium majus (conidia length ⁓11–15 μm), and four from PNG were identified as Metarhizium pingshaense (conidia length ⁓4–6 μm). The most virulent isolate was M. majus AgR-F717, which caused 100 % mortality in 20–23 days against a CRB variant from the CRB-S grouping (clade II) in laboratory bioassays carried out in PNG. Isolates of M. pingshaense did not show pathogenicity against CRB larvae. M. majus AgR-F717 was also the most virulent in laboratory bioassays using the mixed SI population (from both CRB-S and CRB-G groupings) and was selected for further evaluation using artificial breeding sites. Under field conditions, this isolate demonstrated its ability to infect CRB, dispersal up to 100 m from treated artificial breeding sites, and persistence in soil for at least four months. The new isolate AgR-F717 of M. majus has demonstrated potential as an augmentative biological control agent for CRB in PNG and SI.

                Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) breeding and survival in decaying coconut wood was studied in 53 plots (each 9 ha) in southern Luzon, Philippines. Compared with stumps and coconut trunks on the ground, dead standing palms were preferred for breeding and con tained baculovirus-infected larvae 5- to 15-fold more frequently. The percentage of bacu lovirus-infected breeding sites increased with density of dead standing palms up to about five dead palms per hectare, but then decreased again. Larva mortality was higher in dead standing palms and stumps than in trunks on the ground. Rainfall was also a significant mortality factor. Palm damage due to O. rhinoceros increased with density of stumps and trunks on the ground but not with density of dead standing palms. It is concluded that in the Philippines dead standing palms can play an important role in spread of baculovirus and regulation of O. rhinoceros populations.

                1. For comparing assessment methods, 0.rhinoceros (L.)  populations were monitored in five 30-50 ha plots in southern Luzon,  Philippines. No consistent correlations were found between number of  beetles caught in traps, amount of palm damage and number of breeding  sites. Apparently, plots were too small to account for fast dispersal of  beetles.  2. Coconut cap traps baited with ethylchrysanthemumate attracted  0. rhinoceros adults searching for breeding sites. Several factors were  identified influencing catches but trapping was found to be unsuitable for  accurately assessing pest populations.  3. A new method which gives estimates on the monthly number of  0.rhinoceros attacks on coconut palms, was tested in the Maldives. Palms  are climbed about once a year and the sequence of fronds, the number and  the position of beetle cuts are recorded.  4. Reduction with age of the length of three teeth on the fore tibia of  0.rhinoceros adults was studied in the Philippines. The data was insuffi cient to obtain a clear correlation between age and length of teeth.  5. The observations indicated that in the Philippines after leaving their  site of pupation, 0.rhinoceros adults spend about 5 weeks feeding on  coconut palms. This is followed by a period of about 7 weeks in breeding  sitesand,on occasion, additional visits to palms. With these estimates it was  possible to relate palm damage records with numbers of feeding adults.

                Examination of populations of the coconut pest Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) from various parts of Indonesia and the Philippines revealed that the baculovirus of Oryctes was the most significant natural control factor of the pest, being present in the Philippines, Sumatra and west Kalimantan but absent in Java, Bali and Lombok. Islands where the virus was present had, on average, less O. rhinoceros damage, in spite of better breeding conditions, than the virus-free islands.
